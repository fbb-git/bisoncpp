bisonc++ (2.3.1) // TO BE DISTRIBUTED

  * Fixed character returned in escaped constants. E.g., at '\'' the \ was
    returned instead of the ' character.

bisonc++ (2.3.0)

  * Dallas A. Clement uncovered a bug in handling semantic values, due to
    which semantic values of tokens returned by some grammars got lost. He
    intended to use a polymorphic semantic value class to pass different kinds
    of semantic values over from the scanner to the parser. This approach was
    the foundation of another regression test example, now added to the set of
    regression tests and described in Bisonc++'s manual. It will also appear
    as an annotated example in the C++ Annotations. Thanks, Dallas, for
    uncovering and reporting that bug.

  * Dallas also noted that mid-rule actions could not refer to semantic values
    of rule components that had already been seen by Bisonc++. This has been
    fixed in this release. Dallas, thanks again!

  * Earlier versions of Bisonc++ used the class OM (Output Mode) to define the
    way objects like (Non)Terminal tokens and (Non)Kernel Items were inserted
    into ostreams. Using OM did not result in the clarity of design I
    originally had in mind. OM is now removed, and instead relevant classes
    support a function `inserter()' allowing sources to specify (passing
    `inserter()' a pointer to a member function) what kind of insertion they
    need. For the Terminal class there is also a manipulator allowing sources
    to insert a insertion-member directly into the ostream.

  * New option: --insert-stype
    The generated parser will now also display semantic values when %debug is
    specified if the new command-line option --insert-stype is provided. Of
    course, in this case users should make sure that the semantic value is
    actually insertable (e.g., by providing an overloaded operator
    std::ostream &std::operator<<(std::ostream &out, STYPE__ const &semVal).

bisonc++ (2.2.0)

  * Repaired a bug in parsing action blocks of rules appearing only in
    versions 2.1.0 and 2.0.0. In these versions compound statements defined
    within the action blocks result in bisonc++ erroneously reporting an error
    caused by bisonc++'s scanner (scanner/lexer) interpreting the closing
    curly brace as the end of the action block.

  * Repaired a flaw in terminal/terminal1.cc causing a segfault when using
    bisonc++ compiled with g++ 4.2.1

bisonc++ (2.1.0)

  * In the skeleton bisonc++.cc $insert 4 staticdata is followed by $insert
    namespace-open. Since `staticdata' defined s_out if %debug is requested,
    it could be defined outside of the user's namespace (defined by
    %namespace). Repaired by defining s_out after (if applicable) opening the
    namespace (in Generator::namespaceOpen(), called from $insert
    namespace-open). 

bisonc++ (2.0.0)

  * Rebuilt Bisonc++'s parser and scanner, creating Bisonc++'s parser from the
    file parser/grammar. Initially Bisonc++ 1.6.1 was used to create the
    Parser class header and parsing function. Once Bisonc++ 2.0.0 was
    available, the grammar file was split into various subfiles (see below)
    and Bisonc++ 2.0.0 was used to implement its own parsing function.  As a
    direct consequence of using a grammar rather than a hand-implemented
    parsing function quite a few members of the Parser and Scanner class were
    reimplemented, new members were added and some could be removed.  Parts of
    other classes (Rules, Block) were significantly modified as well.

  * Minor hand-modifications may be necessary with previously designed code
    using identifiers that are defined by the parser class generated by
    Bisonc++. The following names have changed:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    old name                        change into new name:           Protected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Parser::LTYPE                   Parser::LTYPE__
    Parser::STYPE                   Parser::STYPE__
    Parser::Tokens                  Parser::Tokens__

    Parser::DEFAULT_RECOVERY_MODE   Parser::DEFAULT_RECOVERY_MODE__ Yes
    Parser::ErrorRecovery           Parser::ErrorRecovery__         Yes
    Parser::Return                  Parser::Return__                Yes
    Parser::UNEXPECTED_TOKEN        Parser::UNEXPECTED_TOKEN__      Yes
    Parser::d_debug                 Parser::d_debug__               Yes
    Parser::d_loc                   Parser::d_loc__                 Yes
    Parser::d_lsp                   Parser::d_lsp__                 Yes
    Parser::d_nErrors               Parser::d_nErrors__             Yes
    Parser::d_nextToken             Parser::d_nextToken__           Yes
    Parser::d_state                 Parser::d_state__               Yes
    Parser::d_token                 Parser::d_token__               Yes
    Parser::d_val                   Parser::d_val__                 Yes
    Parser::d_vsp                   Parser::d_vsp__                 Yes
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The symbols marked `Protected' can only occur in classes that were derived
    from the parser class generated by Bisonc++. Unless you derived a class
    from the parser class generated by Bisonc++ these changes should not
    affect your code. The first three symbols may have been used in other
    classes as well (for an example now using LTYPE__ and STYPE__ see the file 
    documentation/regression/location/scanner/scanner.h).

    Note that the only required modification in all these cases is to append
    two underscores to the previously defined identifiers.

  * The grammar file may now be split into several grammar specification
    files. The directive %include may be specified to include grammar files
    into other grammar files (much like the way C/C++'s #include preprocessor
    directive operates). Starting point of the grammar recognized by Bisonc++
    2.0.0 is the file parser/grammar, using subfiles in the parser/spec
    directory. The file README.parser documents the grammar specification
    files in some detail.

  * Previous releases implicitly enforced several restrictions on the
    identifiers used for the grammar's tokens. These restrictions resulted
    from name collisions with names defined in the parser's base class. While
    the restrictions cannot be completely resolved without giving up backward
    compatibility, they can be relieved greatly. Tokens cannot be ABORT,
    ACCEPT, ERROR, clearin, debug, error and setDebug. Furthermore, tokens
    should not end in two underscores (__).

  * Implemented various new options and directives:

    - the option --analyze-only, merely analyzing the provided grammar, not
      writing any source or header files.

    - the option --error-verbose as well as the directive %error-verbose
      dumping the state-stack when a syntactic error is reported.

    - the option --include-only, catenating all grammar files in their order
      of processing to the standard output stream (and terminating).

    - the option --max-inclusion-depth, defining the maximum number of nested
      grammar files (default: 10).

    - the option --required-tokens (also available as the directive
      %required-tokens). Error recovery is now configurable in the sense that
      a configurable number of tokens must have been successfully processed
      before new error messages can be generated (see
      documentation/manual/error/intro.yo)

    - the option --scanner-debug writing the contents and locations (in
      scanner/lexer) of matched regular expresions as well as the names/values
      of returned tokens to the standard error stream.

    - the option --skeleton-directory. This option overrides the default
      location of the director containing the skeleton files. In turn it is
      overridden by the options specifying specific skeleton files (e.g.,
      --baseclass-skeleton).

    - the option --thread-safe. If specified, Bisonc++ will generate code that
      is thread-safe. I.e., no static data will be modified by the parse()
      function. As a consequence, all static data in the file containing the
      parse() function are defined as const. Manpage and manual adapted
      accordingly.

  * As a convenience, filenames in the grammar files may optionally be
    surrounded by double quotes ("...")  or pointed brackets <...>. Delimiting
    pointed brackets are only kept with the %scanner and %baseclass-preinclude
    directives, in all other cases they are replaced by double quotes and a
    warning is displayed.

  * Token Handling in the generated parsing member function was improved: the
    share/bisonc++.cc skeleton now defines pushToken__() and popToken__() as
    the standard interface to the tiny two-element token stack. The member
    nextToken() was redesigned.

  * Documentation was extended and updated. The Bisonc++ manual now contains an
    extensive description of the grammar-analysis process as implemented in
    Bisonc++ (see documentation/manual/algorith.yo). All new options and
    directives, as well as the token-name requirements are covered by the
    man-page and by the manual.

  * Various other repairs and cosmetic changes: 
    - The --construction option as implemented in Bisonc++ 1.6.1 showed the
      FIRST set where the FOLLOW set was labeled. Repaired: now the FOLLOW set
      is actually displayed.
    - The --show-filenames option now shows `(not requested)' as default for
      d_verboseName instead of `-' if no --verbose was requested.
    - The --construction option no longer displays the `LA expanded' value
      from the state's descriptions since it's always 0
    - The --class-name option was not actually mentioned in the set of
      recognized long options: repaired.
    - The %type directive now allows you to specify semantic type associations
      of terminal tokens as well.
    - The %token, %left, %right and %nonassoc directives now all use the same
      syntax (as they always should have). These directives all define
      terminal tokens
    - Added `rebuild' command to the `build' script to recreate the parser

bisonc++ (1.6.1)

  * Changed the error recovery procedure preventing stack underflows with
    unrecoverable input errors.

  * Added protected parser base class member checkEOF(), terminating the
    parse() member's activities (man-page adapted accordingly).

  * Changed small support member functions in the share/bisonc++.cc skeleton
    file into inline members, some were moved to share/bisonc++base.h

  * The skeleton files now use `\@' as baseclass-flag rather than `@'. The
    baseclass-flag is now defined as a static data member in Generator. This
    change prevents the `@' in e-mail addresses from being changed into the
    parser's class name.

  * Removed the class Support since it is now covered by Bobcat's (1.15.0) 
    default implementation of FBB::TableSupport

bisonc++ (1.6.0)

  * NOTE: THE PROTOTYPE OF THE PARSER'S lookup() FUNCTION CHANGED. IT IS NOW:
    int lookup(bool recovery); 
    OLD parser.h HEADER FILES CAN BE REUSED AFTER ADDING THE PARAMETER 
    bool recovery

  * Segfaults were caused by some grammars due to an erroneous index in
    (formerly state/setitems.cc) state/adddependents.cc, where idx,
    representing an index in d_itemVector was used to index an element in
    d_nextVector (for which the index variable `nextIdx' should have been
    used. Repaired.

  * For some unknown reason, priority and association rules were not
    implemented in earlier versions of bisonc++. Consequently priority and
    association values of rules were left at their default values. This was
    repaired by defining the function Rules::updatePrecedences(), which
    defines priorities of productions as either their values assigned by a
    %prec specification or as the priority of their first terminal token.

  * The accepting State no longer has default reductions. It doesn't need them
    since _EOF_ in those states terminates the parser. Accepting States
    now have search sentinels, allowing the parser to do proper error
    recovery. 

  * The implementation of the shift/reduce algorithm and error handling in
    share/bisonc++.cc was modified, now using bitflags indicating
    state-requirements (e.g., requiring a token, having a default reduction,
    having an `error' continuation, etc.). Also, the functions nextToken() and
    lookup() were reimplemented.

  * The share/bisonc++.cc parser function skeleton's initial comment was
    improved.

  * The function state/state1.cc contained the superfluous intialization 
    d_itemVector(0). The line has been removed.

  * The class `Rules' lacked facilities to detect properly whether a grammar
    file without rules was specified. Solved by defining a Rules constructor
    and an additional member indicating whether there weree any rules at all.

  * In grammar files, rules must now be terminated by a semicolon. Previous
    versions did not explicitly check this. Also, improperly formed
    character-tokens are now recognized as errors. 

  * In correspondence with bison, the default verbose grammar output file is
    now called <grammar filename>.output rather than <parsing function base
    name>.output

  * The description of the State information shown when --construction is
    specified was clarified.

  * The debug output generated by parse.cc was improved.

  * The setDebug() member is now a public member. Manual page and
    documentation changed accordingly. 

  * The description of the setItems() algorithm in state/setItems was
    improved. 

  * The `build' script was given an additional command (installprog) to 
    install just the program and the skeletons.

  * Added several missing headers fixing gcc/g++ 4.3 problems

bisonc++ (1.5.3)

  * Using Bobcat's FnWrap* classes instead of Bobcat's Wrap* classes

  * The INSTALL.im file has received a (by default commented out) 
    #define PROFILE. By activating this define, bisonc++ is compiled with
    support for the gprof profiler. This define should not be activated for
    production versions of bisonc++

  * Not released.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 17 Feb 2007 20:44:19 +0100

bisonc++ (1.5.2)

  * It turns out that the modification in 1.5.1. is not necessary. The
    compilation problems mentioned there were the result of a presumed small
    g++ compiler bug. A workaround is implemented in Bobcat 1.12.1, preventing
    the bug from occurring. In fact, this release has the same contents as
    release 1.5.0. Release 1.5.1. can be considered obsolete. It is available
    from the svn repository only.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 30 Nov 2006 17:05:09 +0100

bisonc++ (1.5.1)

  * Building the usage support program failed because of implied dependencies
    on the bobcat library, resulting from superfluously including bobcat.h in
    the documentation/usage/usage.cc program source.  This is solved by
    setting bisonc++.h's include guard identifier just before inserting
    ../../usage.cc in the documentation/usage/usage.cc program source.

bisonc++ (1.5.0)

  * The algorithms for lookahead propagation and detection of grammars not
    deriving sentences have been redesigned and rewritten. The previously used
    algorithm propagating lookaheads suffered from spurious reduce/reduce
    conflicts for some grammars (e.g., see the one in
    documentation/regression/icmake1). Also, 1.4.0 choked on a (fairly)
    complex grammar like the one used by icmake V 7.00. These problems are now
    solved, and comparable problems should no longer occur.
    
    The layout and organization of the output has been changed as well. Now
    there are basically three forms of verbose output: No verbose output, in
    which the file *.output is not written, standard verbose output, in which
    an overview of the essential parts of the grammar is written to the file
    *.output, and --construction, in which case all lookaheadsets, as well as
    the first and follow sets are written to *.output.

    Multiple new classes were added, and some previously existing classes were
    removed. See the file README.class-setup and the file CLASSES for details.

    The man-page and manual were adapted on minor points.

bisonc++ (1.4.0)

  * It turned out that in the previous versions, S/R conflicts were also
    produced for empty default reductions. Now detectSR() checks whether there
    is one empty reduction. If so, no S/R conflicts are possible in that
    state. Instead a SHIFT (which is already the default solution of a S/R
    conflict) is performed in these situations. So, now for all
    tokens for which a known continuation state exist the known continuation
    state is selected; for all other tokens the default reduction (reducing to
    its associated state) is selected. See state/detectsr.cc for details.
    
    Since the above change also represents a change of algorithm, the
    subversion was incremented. I added a sub-subversion to have a separate
    level of version-numbers for minor modifications.

    The documentation/regression/run script did not properly return to its
    initial working directory, and it called a test that no longer
    existed. Both errors have been repaired.

    Some leftover references to the Academic Free License were replaced by
    references to the GPL.

    The previously used scripts below make/ are obsolete and were removed from
    this and future distributions. Icmake should be used instead, for which a
    top-level script (build) and support scripts in the ./icmake/ directory
    are available. Icmake is available on a great many architectures. See the
    file INSTALL (and INSTALL.im, replacing the previously used INSTALL.cf)
    for further details.

    All plain `unsigned' variables were changed to `size_t'

bisonc++ (1.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * License changed to the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. See the file
    `copyright'. 

    According to the manual page, the debug-output generated by parsers
    created using the --debug option should be user-controllable through the
    `setDebug()' member. These feature is now actually implemented.

    The usage info now correctly shows the -V flag as a synonym for the 
    --verbose option.

    From now on this file will contain the `upstream' changes. The Debian
    related changes are in changelog.Debian.gz

bisonc++ (1.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Following suggestions made by George Danchev, this version was compiled by
    the unstable's g++ compiler (version >= 4.1), which unveiled several flaws
    in the library's class header files. These flaws were removed (i.e.,
    repaired).

    In order to facilitate compiler selection, the compiler to use is defined
    in the INSTALL.cf file.

    The debian control-files (i.e., all files under the debian subdirectory)
    were removed from the source distribution, which is now also named in
    accordance with the Debian policy. A diff.gz file was added.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu,  6 Jul 2006 12:41:43 +0200

bisonc++ (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Synchronized the version back to numbers-only, adapted the debian
    standards and the required bobcat library in the debian/control file.
    No implementation changes as compared to the previous version, but I felt 
    the need to join various sub-sub-versions back to just one standard
    version.

  * Debian's Linda and lintian errors, warnings and notes processed. No
    messages are generated by linda and lintian in this version.

bisonc++ (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bisonc++ Version 1.00 has changed markedly as compared to its predecessor,
    bisonc++ 0.98.510.
    
    The main reason for upgrading to 1.00 following a year of testing the 0.98
    series is that the grammar analysis and lookahead propagation algorithms
    as used in bisonc++ 0.98.510 were either too cumbersome and contained some
    unfortunate errors.
    
    The errors were discovered during my 2005-2006 C++ class, where some
    students produced grammars which were simple, but were incorrectly
    analyzed by bisonc++ 0.98. It turned out that the lookahead (LA)
    propagation contained several flaws. Furthermore, a plain and simple bug
    assigned the last-used priority to terminal tokens appearing literally in
    the grammar (i.e., without explicitly defining them in a %token or
    comparable directive). A simple, but potentially very confusing bug.
    
    At the cosmetic level, the information produced with the --construction
    option was modified, aiming at better legibility of the construction
    process.
    
    The `examples' directory was reduced in size, moving most examples to a
    new directory `regression', which now contains a script `run' that can be
    used to try each of the examples below the `regression' directory. Some of
    the examples call `bison', so in order to run those examples `bison' must
    be installed as well. It usually is.
    
    A minor backward IN-compatibility results from a change in prototype of
    some private parser member functions. This should only affect exising
    Parser.h header files. Simply replacing the `support functions for
    parse()' section shown at the end of the header file by the following
    lines should make your header file up-to-date again. Note that bisonc++
    does not by itself rewrite Parser.h to prevent undoing any modifications
    you may have implemented in the parser-class header file:
    
        // support functions for parse():
            void executeAction(int ruleNr);
            void errorRecovery();
            int lookup();
            void nextToken();
    
    Please note that this version depends on bobcat 1.7.1 or beyond. If you
    compile bobcat yourself, then you may want to know that bobcat's Milter
    and Xpointer classes are not used by bisonc++, so they could optionally be
    left out of bobcat's compilation.

bisonc++ (0.98.510) unstable; urgency=low

  * When no %union has been declared, no $$ warnings are issued anymore about
    non-exisiting types;
    When no %union has been declared a $<type>i or $<type>$ warning is issued
    about non-exisiting types.

    The State table (in the generated parse.cc file) containing `PARSE_ACCEPT'
    was created with a `REDUCE' indication for grammars whose start symbol's
    production rules were non-repetitive. This was repaired in
    state/writestatearray.cc by setting the (positive) non-reduce indication
    for states using shifts and/or the accept state.

    The logic in writeStateArray() was modifed: a separate ShiftReduce::Status
    variable is now used to store the possible actions: SHIFT, REDUCE or
    ACCEPT. The tables show `SHIFTS' if a state uses shifts; `ACCEPTS' if a
    state contains PARSE_ACCEPT; and `REDUCE' otherwise.

bisonc++ (0.98.500) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handling of $<type>i and $<type>$ repaired, added the 
    %negative-dollar-indices directive.

    $<type> specifications were not properly parsed. Instead of $<type>i or
    $<type>$ constructions like $i<type> and $$<type> were parsed, which is
    contrary to the manual's specification. The function parsing the $-values
    is defined in parser/handledollar.cc. 

    The handling of negative $-indices is improved. Negative $-indices are
    used when synthesizing attributes. In that context, $0 is useful, since it
    refers to the nonterminal matched before the current rule is starting to
    be used, allowing rules like `vardef: typename varlist ' where `varlist'
    inherits the type specification defined at `typename'. 

    In most situations indices are positive. Therefore bisonc++ will warn when
    zero or non-positive $-indices are seen. The %negative-dollar-indices
    directive may be used to suppress these warnings.

    $-indices exceeding the number of elements continue to cause an error.

    Added minor modifications to the `build' script.

    Annoying Error: The function `ItemSets::deriveAction()' did not recognize
    the `ACCEPT' action, so some (most ?) grammars could not be properly
    recognized. I applied a quick hack: if an action isn't `shift' or
    `reduce', it can be `accept', resulting in acceptance of the grammar. This
    solves the actual problem, but I'll have to insepct this in a bit more
    detail. For now, it should work ok.

  * When new lookahead set elements are added to existing states,
    d_recheckState in itemsets/lookaheads.cc (ItemSets::checkLookaheads()) was
    reassigned to the state index whose lookaheadset was enlarged. However, if
    that happened for existing state `i' and then, during the same
    state-inspection, for state `j' where j > i, then the recheck would start
    at `j' rather than `i'. This problem was solved by giving d_recheckState
    only a lower value than its current value.
    
    With R/R conflicts involving `ACCEPT' reductions (with, e.g., `S_$: S .'),
    ACCEPT is selected as the chosen alternative. See State::setReduce()
    (state/setreduce.cc). Since this matches with the `first reduction rule'
    principle, it should be ok.
    
    %stype specifications may consist of multiple elements: the remainder of
    the line beyond %stype is interpreted as the type definition. The
    specification should (therefore) not contain comment or other characters
    that are not part of the actual type definition. The man-page is adapted
    accordingly. Same holds true for the %ltype directive
    
    Added a check whether the grammar derives a sentence
    (itemsets/derivesentence.cc). If not, a fatal error is issued. This
    happens at the end of the program's actions, and at this point files
    etc. have already been generated. They are kept rather than removed for
    further reference. Grammars not deriving sentences should probably not be
    used.
    
    The original Bison documentation has been converted to a Bisonc++ user
    guide. Furthermore, a html-converted manual page is now available under
    /usr/share/doc/bisonc++/man

    The `calculator' example used in the man-page is now under
    /usr/share/doc/bisonc++/man/calculator

  * Incomplete default State constructor now explicitly defined, prevents
    the incidental erroneous rapporting of conflicts for some states.

bisonc++ (0.98.001) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a complete rewrite of the former bisonc++ (0.91) version. The
    program bisonc++ is now a C++ program, producing C++ sources, using the
    algorithm for creating LALR-1 grammars as outlined by Aho, Sethi and
    Ullman's (1986) `Dragon' book. The release number will remain 0.98 for a
    while, and 0.98.001 holds the initial package, new style. Also see the
    man-page, since some things have been changed (augmented) since the
    previous version. No dramatic changes in the grammar specification method:
    Bisonc++ still uses bison's way to specify grammars, but some features,
    already obsolete in bisonc++ 0.91 were removed.

    Also note my e-mail address: the U. of Groningen's official policy now is
    to remove department specific information, so it's `@rug.nl' rather than
    `@rc.rug.nl', as used before.

  * Added several missing short options (like -B etc) to the getopt() function
    call. I forgot to add them to the previous version(s). Internally, all old
    C style allocations were changed to C++ style allocations, using operators
    new and delete. Where it was immediately obvious that a vector could be
    used, I now use vectors. The internally used types `core' `shifts' and
    'reductions' (types.h) now use a vector data member rather than an int [1]
    member, which is then allocated to its proper (I may hope) size when the
    structs are allocated.

  * Command-line options now override matching declarations specified in the
    grammar specification file.

    All %define declarations have been removed. Instead their first arguments
    are now used to specify declarations. E.g., %parser-skeleton instead of
    %define parser-skeleton.

    All declarations use lower-case letters, and use only separating hyphens,
    no underscores. E.g., %lsp-needed rather than %define LSP_NEEDED
    The declaration %class-name replaces the former %name declaration

    All yy and YY name prefixes of symbols defined by bisonc++ have been
    removed. The parser-state `yydefault' has been renamed to `defaultstate'.

  * Added d_nError as protected data member to the base class. Missed it
    during the initial conversion. d_nErrors counts the number of parsing
    errors. Replaces yynerrs from bison(++)
