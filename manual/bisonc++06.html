<h1 >Chapter 6: Examples</h1>
Now we show and explain three sample programs written using <strong >bisonc++</strong>: a reverse
polish notation calculator, an algebraic (infix) notation calculator, and a
multi-function calculator. All three have been tested using the Gnu <strong >C++</strong>
compiler version 5.3.1. Each example results in a usable, though limited,
interactive desk-top calculator.
<p>
These examples are simple, but <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammars for real programming languages are
written the same way. You can copy the examples from this document into source
files to create your own versions of these programs. In addition, the <strong >bisonc++</strong>
source archive contains the various source files ready for use.

<h2 >6.1: Rpn: a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator</h2>
The first example is about a simple double-precision reverse polish notation
calculator (a calculator using postfix operators). This example provides a
good starting point, since operator precedence is not an issue. The second
example illustrates how operator precedence is handled.
<p>
All sources for this calculator are found in the
<a href="examples/rpn/index.html">examples/rpn/</a> directory.
<p>
<a name="l89"></a>
<h3 >6.1.1: Declarations for the `rpn' calculator</h3>
    Here are the directives that are used for the reverse polish notation
calculator. As in <strong >C++</strong>, end-of-line comments may be used.
        <pre>
%baseclass-preinclude cmath

%token NUM
%stype double


</pre>

<p>
The grammar file's first (directive) configures <strong >bisonc++</strong> by specifying the
tokens (see section The <strong >bisonc++</strong> Declarations Section). Each terminal symbol that
is not a single-character literal must be declared here (Single-character
literals are normally not declared, but are represented by literal character
constants). In the current example, all arithmetic operators are designated by
single-character literals, so the only terminal symbol that needs to be
declared is <code >NUM</code>, the token type for numeric constants. As <strong >bisonc++</strong> by default
uses the type <code >int</code> as the semantic value type, but a calculator usually
uses floating point values the directive <code >%stype double</code> is used to indicate
that the calculator uses `<code >double</code>' as the type for its semantic values.
<p>
<a name="l90"></a>
<h3 >6.1.2: Grammar rules for the `rpn' calculator</h3>
    Here are the grammar rules for the reverse polish notation calculator.
        <pre>
input:    
        // empty 
| 
        input line
;

line:   
        '\n'
| 
        exp '\n'  
        { 
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "\t" &lt;&lt; $1 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }
;

exp:      
        NUM             
| 
        exp exp '+'     
        { 
            $$ = $1 + $2;    
        }
| 
        exp exp '-'     
        { 
            $$ = $1 - $2;    
        }
| 
        exp exp '*'     
        { 
            $$ = $1 * $2;    
        }
| 
        exp exp '/'     
        { 
            $$ = $1 / $2;    
        }
|
        // Exponentiation:
        exp exp '^'     
        { 
            $$ = pow($1, $2); 
        }
|
        // Unary minus:
        exp 'n'
        { 
            $$ = -$1;        
        }
;

</pre>

<p>
The rules of the <code >rpn</code> `language' defined here are the expression
(using the name <code >exp</code>), the line of input (<code >line</code>), and the complete input
transcript (<code >input</code>). Each of these nonterminal symbols has several
alternate rules, joined by the `<code >|</code>' separator, separating the various
production rules. The various rules are explained next.
<p>
The semantics of the language are determined by the actions taken once
nonterminals have been recognized. The actions consist of <strong >C++</strong> code that
appears inside braces. See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#ACTIONS">4.6.2</a>.
<p>
Actions are specified using <strong >C++</strong>, but <strong >bisonc++</strong> provides the means for passing
semantic values between rules. Refer to section <a href="bisonc++04.html#ACTIONS">4.6.2</a> below for an
extensive coverage of the various possibilities. As a short introduction, the
pseudo-variable <code >$$</code> can be used in rules to represent the semantic value
for the nonterminal that the production rule is defining. Assigning a value to
<code >$$</code> is the main task of many actions. The semantic values of the elements
of production rules are referred to as <code >$1</code> (the first element of a
production rule), <code >$2</code> (the second element), and so on.
<p>
<a name="l91"></a>
<h4 >6.1.2.1: Explanation of `input'</h4>
        Consider the definition of <code >input</code>:
        <pre>

    input:    
            // empty 
    | 
            input line
    ;
        
</pre>

    This definition should be read as follows: <em >A complete input is either
an empty string, or a complete input followed by an input line</em>. Notice that
`complete input' is defined in terms of itself. This definition is said to be
<em >left recursive</em> since the rule's nonterminal (<code >input</code>) appears as the
leftmost symbol in the production rule. See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#RECURSIVE">4.4</a>.
<p>
The first alternative is empty: there are no symbols between the colon and the
first `<code >|</code>'; this means that input can match an empty string of input (no
tokens). We write the rules this way because it is legitimate to type
<code >Ctrl-d</code> (end of input) immediately after starting the calculator. By
convention empty alternatives are provided with the comment `<code >// empty</code>'.
<p>
The second production rule (`<code >input line</code>') handles all nontrivial input. It
means <em >after reading any number of lines, read one more line</em>. The left
recursion turns this rule into a loop: it processes any number of lines.
<p>
The parser's parsing function continues to process input until a grammatical
error is encountered or untilthe lexical analyzer returns the end-of-file
token. 
<p>
<a name="l92"></a>
<h4 >6.1.2.2: Explanation of `line'</h4>
        Next consider the definition of the <code >line</code> nonterminal:
        <pre>

    line:   
            '\n'
    | 
            exp '\n'  
            { 
                cout &lt;&lt; "\t" &lt;&lt; $1 &lt;&lt; endl;
            }
    ;
        
</pre>

    The first alternative is a newline character token; this means that
<code >rpn</code> accepts a blank line (and ignores it, since it has no associated
action). The second alternative is an <em >expression</em> (<code >expr</code>), followed by a
newline. This alternative handles all expressions that are entered by the
user. The semantic value of the <code >exp</code> nonterminal is the value of <code >$1</code>
because the <code >exp</code> nonterminal is the first symbol of the production
rule. The action simply prints the expression's value.
<p>
This action is unusual because it does not assign a value to <code >$$</code>. As a
consequence, the semantic value associated with <code >line</code> is not defined. This
becomes a bug if that value is ever used, but we don't use it: once <code >rpn</code>
has printed the value of the user's input line, that value is no longer
needed.
<p>
<a name="l93"></a>
<h4 >6.1.2.3: Explanation of `expr'</h4>
        The <code >exp</code> nonterminal has several rules, one for each kind of
expression. The first rule handles the simplest kind of expression: just a
single number. The second handles additions, which are two expressions
followed by a plus-sign. The third handles subtractions, and so on.
        <pre>

    exp:      
            NUM             
    | 
            exp exp '+'     
            { 
                $$ = $1 + $2;    
            }
    | 
            exp exp '-'     
            { 
                $$ = $1 - $2;    
            }
    ...
        
</pre>

    Normally the production rule separator `<code >|</code>' is used to separate the
various production rules, but the rules could equally well have separately
been defined:
        <pre>

    exp:      
            NUM             
    ;

    exp:
            exp exp '+'     
            { 
                $$ = $1 + $2;    
            }
    ;

    exp:
            exp exp '-'     
            { 
                $$ = $1 - $2;    
            }
    ;

    ...
        
</pre>

    Most rules have actions assoicated with them computing the value of the
expression using the values of the elements of production rules. For example,
in the rule for addition, <code >$1</code> refers to the first component <code >exp</code> and
<code >$2</code> refers to the second one. The third component, '<code >+</code>', has no semantic
value associated with it, but if it had you could refer to it as <code >$3</code>. When
the parser's parsing function recognizes a sum expression using this rule, the
sum of the two subexpressions' values is produced as the value of the entire
expression. See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#ACTIONS">4.6.2</a>.
<p>
You don't have to define actions for every rule. When a rule has no action,
<strong >bisonc++</strong> by default copies the value of <code >$1</code> into <code >$$</code>. This is what happens
in the first rule (the one that uses <code >NUM</code>).
<p>
The formatting shown here shows  the recommended layout, but <strong >bisonc++</strong> does not
require it. You can alter whitespace as much as you like.
<p>
<a name="RPNLEX"></a><a name="l94"></a>
<h3 >6.1.3: The Lexical Scanner used by `rpn'</h3>
    The lexical analyzer's job is to convert characters or sequences of characters
read from the input stream into tokens. <strong >Bisonc++</strong>'s parser obtains its tokens by
calling its lexical analyzer member (<code >lex</code>), which is a predefined member
of the parser class. See section <a href="bisonc++05.html#LEX">5.3.1</a>.
<p>
Our calculator only needs a simple lexical analyzer. It skips blanks and tabs,
then reads numbers, returning them as <code >NUM</code> tokens. Any other character that
isn't part of a number is a separate token. Note that the token-value for such
a single-character token is the character itself.
<p>
The lexical analyzer function's return value is a numeric value representing a
token. If the token is a literal character, then its numeric code is the
character's <code >ASCII</code> code; if the token is the name of a token defined by <strong >bisonc++</strong>
in a grammar specification file, then such named tokens are defined by <strong >bisonc++</strong> in
a <strong >C++</strong> enumeration. In the current example, therefore, <code >NUM</code> becomes an
enumeration value, returned by the <code >lex</code> member as the `value' <code >NUM</code>.
<p>
Semantic values of nonterminals are stored in the parser's data member
<code >d_val__</code> (comparable to the variable <code >yylval</code> used by, e.g., Bison). This
data member has <code >int</code> as its default type, but by specifying <code >%stype</code> in
the grammar file's directive section this default type is modified (to, e.g.,
<code >double</code>).
<p>
A token value of zero is returned once end-of-file is encountered (the parsing
function produced by <strong >bisonc++</strong> interprets any nonpositive token value as
end-of-input).
<p>
Here is the lexical scanner's implementation:
    <pre >
#include "Parser.ih"

/*
    Lexical scanner returns a double floating point 
    number on the stack and the token NUM, or the ASCII
    character read if not a number.  Skips all blanks
    and tabs, returns 0 for EOF.
*/

int Parser::lex()
{
    char c;
                                    // get the next non-ws character
    while (std::cin.get(c) &amp;&amp; (c == ' ' || c == '\t'))
        ;

    if (!std::cin)                  // no characters were obtained
        return 0;                   // indicate End Of Input  
    
    if (c == '.' || isdigit(c))     // if a digit char was found
    {
        std::cin.putback(c);        // return the character
        std::cin &gt;&gt; d_val__;        // extract a number
        return NUM;                 // return the NUM token
    }

    return c;                       // otherwise return the extracted char.
}

</pre>

<p>
<a name="l95"></a>
<h3 >6.1.4: The Controlling Function `main()'</h3>
    In keeping with the spirit of this example, the calcuator's
<code >main</code> function is a very small one.  It
constructs a parser object and then calls its parsing function to
start the calculator:
    <pre >
#include "main.ih"

int main()
{
    Parser parser;

    parser.parse();
}
</pre>

<p>
<a name="l96"></a>
<h3 >6.1.5: The error reporting member `error()'</h3>
    When <code >parse</code> encounters a <em >syntax error</em>, it calls the error reporting
member function (<code >error</code>) to print an error message. A very basic in-line
implementation is provided by <strong >bisonc++</strong> in the parser class internal header file
(see chapter <a href="bisonc++05.html#INTERFACE">5</a>), which can easily be redefined by the
programmer. The <code >error</code> member's default implementation is OK for
<code >rpn</code>.
<p>
Once <code >error</code> returns, <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s parser may recover from the error and continue
parsing if the grammar contains a suitable error rule (see chapter
<a href="bisonc++08.html#RECOVERY">8</a>).  Otherwise, the parsing function <code >parse</code> returns a non-zero
value. No error production rules were used for <code >rpn</code>, so the calculator
terminates at the first syntax error.. Not very nice in a real-life
calculator, but it is acceptable for this first example.
<p>
<a name="l97"></a>
<h3 >6.1.6: Running Bisonc++ to generate the Parser</h3>
    Before running <strong >bisonc++</strong>, we should decide how to organize the program's source
code, using one or more source files. Even though the example is simple, it is
good practice to define all user-defined functions in source files of their
own. For <code >rpn</code> this means that a source file (<code >main.cc</code>) is constructed
holding <code >main</code>, and a file <code >parser/lex.cc</code> containing the lexical
scanner's implementation. Note that I've put all the parser's files in a
separate directory as well (also see section <a href="bisonc++03.html#LAYOUT">3.7</a>).
<p>
In  <a href="examples/rpn/parser">rpn's parser</a> directory the file <code >grammar</code>
contains the grammar specification. <strong >Bisonc++</strong> constructs a parser class and a
parsing member function from this file after issuing the command:
        <pre>

    b() grammar
        
</pre>

    From this, <strong >bisonc++</strong> produced the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><code >Parser.h</code>, the parser class definition;
    <li><code >Parserbase.h</code>, the parser's <em >base</em> class definition, defining, among
other, the grammatical tokens to be used by externally defined lexical
scanners;
    <li><code >Parser.ih</code>, the <em >internal header file</em>, to be included by all
implementations of the parser class' members;
    <li><code >parse.cc</code>, the parsing member function.
    </ul>
    By default, <code >Parserbase.h</code> and <code >parse.cc</code> will be <em >re-created</em> each
time <strong >bisonc++</strong> is re-run. <code >Parser.h</code> and <code >Parser.ih</code> may safely be modified
by the programmer, e.g., to add new members to to the parser class. These two
files will not be overwritten by <strong >bisonc++</strong>, unless explicitly instructed to do
so. 
<p>
<a name="l98"></a>
<h3 >6.1.7: Constructing and running `rpn'</h3>
    Here is how to compile and run the parser file:
        <pre>

    # List files (recursively) in the (current) examples/rpn  directory.
    % ls -R 
    .:
    build*  main.cc  parser/  rpn.ih
    
    ./parser:
    grammar  lex.cc  Parser.ih
    
    # Create `rpn' using the `build' script:
    % ./build program
    
    # List files again, ./rpn is the constructed program
    % ls -R
    .:
    build*  main.cc  parser/  program*  rpn.ih
    
    ./parser:
    grammar  grammar.output  lex.cc  parse.cc  Parserbase.h  Parser.h  Parser.ih
        
</pre>

<p>
Here is an example session using the calculator:
        <pre>

    % program

            13
    3 7 + 3 4 5 *+-

<a name="CALC"></a><a name="l99"></a>
<h2 >6.2: `calc': an Infix Notation Calculator</h2>
We now modify <code >rpn</code> to handle infix operators instead of postfix. Infix
notation requires us to define operator precedence and to extend the grammar
with nested expressions. Here is <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s grammar specification for <code >calc</code>, an
infix calculator:
        <pre >
%baseclass-preinclude   cmath

        }

            $$ = $1 / $3;
        }
| 
        '-' exp %prec NEG
        { 
            $$ = -$2;
        }

        // Exponentiation:
        exp '^' exp 
        { 
            $$ = pow($1, $3);
        }

        '(' exp ')'
        { 
            $$ = $2;
        }

</pre>

    The functions <code >lex</code>, <code >error</code> and <code >main</code> are identical to the ones 
used with <code >rpn</code>.
<p>
This example illustrates  several important new features:
    <ul>
    <li> In the first section (<strong >bisonc++</strong> directives), <code >%left</code> declares token types
stating that the mentioned operators are left-associative. The directives
<code >%left</code> and <code >%right</code> (right associativity) are used instead of <code >%token</code>,
which is merely used to declare a token identifier. The tokens mentioned with
<code >%left</code> and <code >%right</code> are single-character tokens, which ordinarily don't
need to be declared. We declare them here to specify their priority and
associativity.
    <li> Operator precedence is determined by the ordering of the directives;
the earlier <code >%left</code> and <code >%right</code> are specified, the lower the priority of
the operators that are following these keywords. So addition/subtraction have
the lowest precedence, multiplication and division are next, then unary minus
(<code >NEG</code>), and exponentiation has the highest precedence. See section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#PRECEDENCE">4.5.9</a>.
    <li> Another important new feature is the <code >%prec</code> directive encountered
in the grammar section at the definition of the unary minus operator
production rule. The <code >%prec</code> directive indicates that the minus operator in
the production rule `<code >'-' exp</code>' has <code >NEG's</code>, rather than the minus
(<code >'-'</code>) operator's precedence. See section <a href="bisonc++07.html#CONDEP">7.3</a>.
    </ul>
<p>
Here is a sample run of <code >calc</code>:
        <pre>

    % calc
    4 + 4.5 - (34/(8*3+-3))
            6.88095

Up to this point, error-recovery hasn't yet been covered i.e., how to continue
parsing after the parser detects a syntax error. By default <code >parse</code> returns
after calling <code >error</code>. This means that an erroneous input line ends the
calculator. Now we show how to recover from erroneous input.
<p>
The <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammar-specification language includes the reserved symbol <code >error</code>,
which can be used in production rules. In the example below it has been added
as a new alternative for recognizing the <code >line</code> nonterminal:
        <pre>
line:   
        '\n'
| 
        exp '\n'  
        { 
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "\t" &lt;&lt; $1 &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
| 
        error '\n'
;

</pre>

<p>
This addition to the grammar allows the calculator to recover from syntax
errors. If a syntax error is encountered, the third production rule is
activated, skipping all tokens until a newline token has been encounters. At
that point <code >line</code> has been recognized, and parsing continues afresh at the
next input line (the <code >error</code> member function is also called, printing its
message). Different from bison's <code >error</code> implementation, <strong >bisonc++</strong> proceeds on the
assumption that whenever <code >error</code> is used in a production rule it is the
grammar constructor's intention to have the parser continue parsing
(therefore, a statement like `<code >yyerrok</code>', encountered in bison grammars is
superfluous in <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammars). The reserved symbol <code >error</code> itself causes the
parsing function to skip all subsequent input until a token that can follow
<code >error</code> has been encountered. In the above implementation that token is the
newline character `<code >\n</code>' (see chapter <a href="bisonc++08.html#RECOVERY">8</a>).
<p>
This form of error recovery deals with syntax errors. There are other
kinds of errors; for example, divisions by zero, which raises an exception
signal that is normally fatal. A real calculator program must handle this
signal and use whatever it takes to discard the rest of the current line of
input and resume parsing thereafter. Handling such signals and other forms of
semantic errors is not discussed here, as it is not specific to <strong >bisonc++</strong>
programs. But once a semantic error has been encountered, handling functions
may call <code >ERROR()</code>, resulting in the same procedure as the one that's used
for syntax errors: all subsequenct tokens are skipped until a token has been
encountered that can follow the reserved symbol <code >error</code>.

<h2 >6.4: `mfcalc': a Multi-Function Calculator</h2>
Now that the basics of using <strong >bisonc++</strong> have been discussed, it is time to move on to
a more advanced problem. The above calculators provided only offer the
operators <code >+, - * /</code> and <code >^</code>. It would be nice to have a calculator that
allows us to use some other mathematical functions as well, such as <code >sin</code>,
<code >cos</code>, etc..
<p>
It is easy to add new operators to the infix calculator as long as they are
only single-character literals. The parser's member <code >lex</code> returns all
non-number characters as tokens, so only some new grammar production rules
need to be added to the grammar when such tokens must be recognized. But we
want something more flexible: built-in functions that can be called like this:
        <pre>

    function_name (argument)
        
</pre>

    At the same time, we add memory to the calculator, allowing us to use
variables. Here is a sample session with the multi-function calculator:
        <pre>

	pi = 3.141592653589
	        3.14159
	sin(pi)
	        7.93266e-13
	alpha = beta1 = 2.3
	        2.3
	alpha
	        2.3
	ln(alpha)
	        0.832909
	exp(ln(beta1))
	        2.3
        
</pre>

Note that multiple assignment and nested function calls are supported.

<h3 >6.4.1: The Declaration Section for `mfcalc'</h3>
    The grammar specification file for the <code >mfcalc</code> calculator shows several new
features. Here is the <strong >bisonc++</strong> directive section for the <code >mfcalc</code> multi-function
calculator (line numbers were added for referential purposes, they are not
part of the declaraction section as used in the actual grammar file):
        <pre>

    1   %union
    2   {
    3       double u_val;
    4       double *u_symbol;
    5       double (*u_fun)(double);
    6   }
    7
    8   %token &lt;u_val&gt;  NUM         // Simple double precision number
    9   %token &lt;u_symbol&gt; VAR       // Variable
   10   %token &lt;u_fun&gt;  FNCT        // Function
   11   %type  &lt;u_val&gt;  exp
   12
   13   %right '='
   14   %left '-' '+'
   15   %left '*' '/'
   16   %left NEG                   // negation--unary minus 
   17   %right '^'                  // exponentiation        
        
</pre>

    The above specifications show  two new features of <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s grammar
specification language, allowing semantic values to have different data types.
    <ul>
    <li> The <code >%union</code> directive (given in lines 1 through 6) allows semantic
values to have various data types (see section <a href="bisonc++04.html#UNION">4.5.31</a>). It is used
instead of <code >%stype</code>, and defines <code >Parser::STYPE__</code> as a the union type:
all semantic values now have this type. Now semantic values can have any of
the types that are defined as the union's fields.
    <li> The <code >%type</code> directive is used to associate (non)terminal tokens with
the types of the fields of the union:
    <ul>
    <li><code >double</code> (for <code >exp</code> and <code >NUM</code>); 
    <li> a <em >pointer</em> to a <code >double</code>, being a pointer to entries in
        <code >mfcalc</code>'s symbol table, used with <code >VAR</code> tokens.
    <li> a <em >pointer to a function</em> expecting a <code >double</code> argument and
        returning a <code >double</code> value, used with <code >FNCT</code> tokens.
    </ul>
    Since semantic values no longer are of one single type, each grammar
symbol whose semantic value is used must explicitly be associated with one of
the types of the fields of the union. This holds true for the symbols <code >NUM,
VAR, FNCT</code>, and <code >exp</code>. The <code >%type</code> directive first specifies (between
angle brackets) one of the union's field types, followed by a list of (blank
or comma separated) nonterminal or terminal symbols which are associated with
the specified union field type.
    </ul>
    Finally note the <em >right associative</em> operator `<code >=</code>', defined in line
13: by making the assignment operator right-associative we can allow
<em >sequential assignments</em> of the form <code >a = b = c = expression</code>.
<p>
<a name="l103"></a>
<h3 >6.4.2: Grammar Rules for `mfcalc'</h3>
    Here are the grammar rules for the multi-function calculator. Most of them are
copied directly from <code >calc</code>. Three rules, mentioning <code >VAR</code> or
<code >FNCT</code>, are new:
        <pre >
input:    
        // empty 
| 
        input line
;

line:   
        '\n'
| 
        exp '\n'  
        { 
            cout &lt;&lt; "\t" &lt;&lt; $1 &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
| 
        error '\n'
;

exp:      
        NUM             
| 
        VAR                
        { 
            $$ = *$1;
        }
| 
        VAR '=' exp        
        { 
            $$ = *$1 = $3;
        }
| 
        FNCT '(' exp ')'   
        { 
            $$ = (*$1)($3); 
        }
| 
        exp '+' exp 
        { 
            $$ = $1 + $3;
        }
| 
        exp '-' exp 
        { 
            $$ = $1 - $3;
        }
| 
        exp '*' exp 
        { 
            $$ = $1 * $3;
        }
| 
        exp '/' exp 
        { 
            $$ = $1 / $3;
        }
| 
        '-' exp %prec NEG
        { 
            $$ = -$2;
        }
|
        // Exponentiation:
        exp '^' exp 
        { 
            $$ = pow($1, $3);
        }
|
        '(' exp ')'
        { 
            $$ = $2;
        }
;

<h3 >6.4.3: The `mfcalc' Symbol- and Function Tables</h3>
    The multi-function calculator needs a symbol table for keeping track of the
names and meanings of variables and functions. This doesn't affect the grammar
rules or the calculator's directives, but it requires that the parser class
defines some additional <strong >C++</strong> types as well as several additional data
members.
<p>
The symbol table itself varies in size and contents once <code >mfcalc</code> is
used. It is defined as the <em >data member</em>
<code >d_symbols</code> in the Parser's header file. In contrast, the <em >function table</em>
has a <em >fixed</em> size and contents. Because of this the function table is
defined as a <em >static</em> data member. Both tables are defined as 
<code >std::unordered_map</code> containers: their keys are
<code >std::string</code> objects, their values, respecively, <code >double</code>s and <code >double
(*)(double)</code>s. Here is the declaration of <code >d_symbols</code> and <code >s_functions</code> as
used in <code >mfcalc</code>'s parser:
        <pre>

    std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, double&gt; d_symbols;

    static std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, double (*)(double)&gt; s_functions;
        
</pre>

    As <code >s_functions</code> is a static member, it can be initialized <em >compile
time</em> from an <em >array of pairs</em>. To ease the definition of such an array a
<code >private typedef</code>
        <pre>

    typedef std::pair&lt;char const *, double (*)(double)&gt; FunctionPair;
        
</pre>

    is added to the parser class, as well as a private array
        <pre>

    static FunctionPair s_funTab[];
        
</pre>

    These definitions allow us to initialize <code >s_functions</code> in a separate
source file (<code >data.cc</code>):
        <pre >
#include "Parser.ih"

Parser::FunctionPair Parser::s_funTab[] =
{
    FunctionPair("sin",  sin),
    FunctionPair("cos",  cos),
    FunctionPair("atan", atan),
    FunctionPair("ln",   log),
    FunctionPair("exp",  exp),
    FunctionPair("sqrt", sqrt),
};

unordered_map&lt;string, double (*)(double)&gt; Parser::s_functions
(
    Parser::s_funTab, 
    Parser::s_funTab + sizeof(Parser::s_funTab) / sizeof(Parser::FunctionPair)
);



</pre>

    By simply editing the definition of <code >s_funTab</code>, additional
functions can be added to the calculator.
<p>
<a name="MFLEX"></a><a name="l105"></a>
<h3 >6.4.4: The new `lex()' member</h3>
    In <code >mfcalc</code>, the parser's member function <code >lex()</code> must now recognize
variables, function names, numeric values, and the single-character arithmetic
operators. Strings of alphanumeric characters not starting with a digit are
recognized as either variables or functions depending on the table in which
they are found. By arranging <code >lex</code>'s logic such that the function table is
searched first it is simple to ensure that no variable can ever have the name
of a predefined function. The implementation used here, in which two
different tables are used for the arithmetic functions and the variable
symbols is appealing because it's simple to implement. However, it also has
the drawback of being difficult to scale to more generic calculators, using,
e.g., different data types and different types of functions. In such
situations a single symbol table is more preferable, where the keys are the
identifiers (variables, function names, predefined constants, etc.) while the
values are objects describing their characteristics. A re-implementation of
<code >mfcalc</code> using an integrated symbol table is suggested in one of the
exercises of the next section <a href="bisonc++06.html#EXERCISES">6.5</a>.
<p>
The parser's <code >lex</code> member has these characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li> All leading blanks and tabs are skipped
    <li> If no (other) character could be obtained 0 is returned, indicating
        End-Of-File. 
    <li> If the first non-blank character is a dot or number, a number is
        extracted from the standard input. Since the semantic value data
        member of <code >mfcalc</code>'s parser (<code >d_val</code>) is itself also a <code >union</code>,
        the numerical value can be extracted into <code >d_val__.u_val</code>, and a
        <code >NUM</code> token can be returned.
    <li> If the first non-blank character is not a letter, then a
        single-character token was received and the character's value is
        returned as the next token.
    <li> Otherwise the read character is a letter. This character and all
        subsequent alpha-numeric characters are extracted to construct the
        name of an identifier. Then this identifier is searched for in the
        <code >s_functions</code> map. If found, <code >d_val__.u_fun</code> is given the function's
        address, found as the value of the <code >s_functions</code> map element
        corresponding to the read identifier, and token <code >FNCT</code> is returned.
        If the symbol is not found in <code >s_functions</code> the address of the
        value ofn <code >d_symbols</code> associated with the received identifier is
        assigned to <code >d_val__.u_symbol</code> and token <code >VAR</code> is returned. Note
        that this automatically defines newly used variables, since
        <code >d_symbols[name]</code> automatically inserts a new element in a map if
        <code >d_symbol[name]</code> wasn't already there.
    </ul>
    Here is the parser's <code >lex</code> member function:
        <pre >
#include "Parser.ih"

/*
    Lexical scanner returns a double floating point 
    number on the stack and the token NUM, or the ASCII
    character read if not a number.  Skips all blanks
    and tabs, returns 0 for EOF.
*/

int Parser::lex()
{
    char c;
                                    // get the next non-ws character
    while (cin.get(c) &amp;&amp; (c == ' ' || c == '\t'))
        ;

    if (!cin)                   // no characters were obtained
        return 0;                   // indicate End Of Input  
    
    if (c == '.' || isdigit (c))    // if a digit char was found
    {
        cin.putback(c);        // return the character
        cin &gt;&gt; d_val__.u_val;    // extract a number
        return NUM;                 // return the NUM token
    }
    
    if (!isalpha(c))                // c doesn't start an identifier: 
        return c;                   // return a single character token.

    // in all other cases, an ident is entered. Recognize a var or function

    string word;           // store the name in a string object

    while (true)                // process all alphanumerics:
    {
        word += c;              // add 'm to `word'
        if (!cin.get(c))   // no more chars? then done here
            break;

        if (!isalnum(c))        // not an alphanumeric: put it back and done.
        {
            cin.putback(c);
            break;
        }
    }
                                // Now lookup the name as a function's name
    unordered_map&lt;string, double (*)(double)&gt;::iterator function = 
                                                s_functions.find(word);

                                // Got it, so return FPTR 
    if (function != s_functions.end())  
    {
        d_val__.u_fun = function-&gt;second;
        return FNCT;
    }
                                // no function, so return a VAR. Set
                                // u_symbol to the symbol's address in the
                                // d_symbol map. The map will add the
                                // symbol if not yet there.
    d_val__.u_symbol = &amp;d_symbols[word];
    return VAR;            
}

<h3 >6.4.5: Constructing `mfcalc'</h3>
    In order to construct <code >mfcalc</code>, the following steps are suggested:
    <ul>
    <li> Construct a program <code >mfcalc.cc</code>. Actually, it is already available,
        since all implementations of <code >main()</code> used so far are identical to
        each other.
    <li> Construct the parser in a subdirectory <code >parser</code>:
        <ul>
        <li> First, construct <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s input file as indicated above. Name
            this file <code >grammar</code>;
        <li> Run <code >bisonc++ grammar</code> to produce the files <code >Parser.h</code>,
            <code >Parserbase.h</code>, <code >Parser.ih</code> and <code >parse.cc</code>;
        <li> Modify <code >Parser.h</code> so as to include <code >FunctionPair, 
            s_functions, s_funTab</code> and <code >d_symbols</code>;
        <li> Modify <code >Parser.ih</code> so as to include <code >cmath</code> and optionally
            `<code >using namespace std</code>', which is commented out by default;
        <li> Implement <code >data.cc</code> and <code >lex.cc</code> to initialize the static
            data and to contain the lexical scanner, respectively.
        </ul>
    <li> Now construct <code >mfcalc</code> in <code >mfcalc.cc</code>'s directory using the
        following command: 
            <pre>

    g++ -o mfcalc *.cc parser/*.cc
            
</pre>

    </ul>
<p>
<a name="EXERCISES"></a><a name="l107"></a>
<h2 >6.5: Exercises</h2>
Here are some suggestions for you to consider to improve <code >mfcalc</code>'s
implementation and operating mode:
    <ul>
    <li> Add some additional functions from `<code >cmath</code>' to the
        <code >Parser::s_functions</code>;
    <li> Define a class <code >Symbol</code> in which the symbol type, and an
appropriate value for the symbol is stored. Define only one map <code >d_symbols</code>
in the Parser, and provide the <code >Symbol</code> class with means to obtain the
appropriate values for the various token types.
    <li> Remove the <code >%union</code> directive, and change it into <code >%stype
Symbol</code>. Hint: use the <code >%preinclude-header</code> directive to make
<code >Symbol</code> known to the parser's base class.
    <li> Define a token <code >CONST</code> for numerical constants (like <code >PI</code>, (E)),
and pre-define some numerical constants;
    <li> Make the program report an error if the user refers to an
uninitialized variable in any way except to store a value in it. Hints: use a
<code >get()</code> and <code >set()</code> member pair in <code >Symbol</code>, and use the appropriate
member in the appropriate <code >expr</code> rule; use <code >ERROR()</code> to initiate error
recovery.
