<h1 >Chapter 4: Bisonc++ grammar files</h1>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> processes a context-free grammar specification, producing a
<strong >C++</strong> class offering various predefined members, among which the member
<code >parse</code>, that recognizes correct instances of the grammar.
<p>
In this chapter the organization and specification of such a grammar file is
discussed in detail.
<p>
Having read this chapter you should be able to define a grammar for which <strong >Bisonc++</strong>
can generate a class, containing a member that recognizes correctly formulated
(according to the grammar) input. Such a grammar must be in the class of
<strong >LALR(1)</strong> grammars (see, e.g., <em >Aho, Sethi &amp; Ullman</em>, 2003
(Addison-Wesley)).
<p>
<a name="OUTLINE"></a><a name="l15"></a>
<h2 >4.1: Outline of a Bisonc++ Grammar File</h2>
The input file for <strong >bisonc++</strong> is a grammar file. Different from Bison++ and Bison
grammar files, <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammar file consist of just two sections. The general form
of a <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammar file looks like this:
        <pre>

    Bisonc++ directives
    %%
    Grammar rules
        
</pre>

    Readers familiar with Bison may note that there is no <em >C declaration
section</em> and no section to define <em >Additional C code</em>. With <strong >bisonc++</strong> these
sections are superfluous since, due to the fact that a <strong >bisonc++</strong> parser is defined
as a <strong >C++</strong> class, all additional code required for the parser's
implementation can be incorporated into the parser class itself. Also, <strong >C++</strong>
classes normally only require declarations that can be defined in the classes'
header files, so also the `additional C code' section was omitted from
<strong >bisonc++</strong>'s grammar file.
<p>
The `%%' is a separator that appears in every <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammar file 
separating the two sections.
<p>
The directives section is used to declare the names of the terminal and
nonterminal symbols, and may also describe operator precedence and the data
types of semantic values of various symbols. Additional directives are used to
define, e.g., the name of the generated parser class and a namespace in which
the parser class is defined.  All <strong >bisonc++</strong> directives are covered in section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#DIRECTIVES">4.5</a>.
<p>
Grammar rules define how to construct <em >nonterminal symbols</em>.  The grammar
rules section defines one or more <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammar rules. See
section <a href="bisonc++04.html#RULES">4.3</a>, covering the syntax of grammar rules.
<p>
The `%%' separator must always be specified, even if the directives section is
empty.
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong>'s grammar file may be split into several files. Each file may be given a
suggestive name. This allows quick identification of where a particular
section or rule is found, and improves readability of the designed
grammar. The <a href="bisonc++04.html#INCLUDE">%include</a>-directive (see section <a href="bisonc++04.html#INCLUDE">4.5.8</a>) can
be used to include a partial grammar specification file into another
specification file.
<p>
<a name="SYMBOLS"></a><a name="l16"></a>
<h2 >4.2: Symbols, Terminal and Nonterminal Symbols</h2>
<em >Symbols</em> are the building blocks of <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammars.
<p>
A <em >terminal symbol</em> (also known as a <em >token</em>) represents a class of
syntactically equivalent symbols. Tokens are represented in <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s parser class
by a number, defined in an enum. The parser's <code >lex</code> member function returns
a token value indicating what kind of token has been read. You don't need to
know what the code value is; instead, its symbol should always be used.  By
convention, it contains uppercase characters.
<p>
<em >Nonterminal symbol</em> define concepts of grammars. The symbol name is used in
writing grammar rules. By convention, it contains lowercase characters.
<p>
Symbol names consist of letters, digits (not at the beginning), and
underscores. <strong >Bisonc++</strong> does not support periods in symbol names
(users familiar with Bison may observe that Bison <em >does</em> support periods in
symbol names, but the Bison's user guide states that `periods make sense only
in nonterminals'. Even so, it appears that periods in symbols are hardly ever
used).
<p>
There are two ways terminal symbols can be referred to:
    <ul>
    <li> A <em >named token</em> is an identifier, like an identifier in
<strong >C++</strong>. Each token name must be defined with a <strong >bisonc++</strong> directive such as
<code >%token</code>. See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#TOKTYPENAMES">4.5.27</a>.
    <li> A <code >character token</code> (or <code >literal character token</code>) is written in
the grammar using <strong >C++</strong>'s character constants syntax; for example, '<code >+</code>'
is a character token. A character token doesn't need to be declared unless you
need to specify its semantic value data type (cf. section <a href="bisonc++04.html#SEMANTICS">4.6</a>),
associativity, or precedence (cf. section <a href="bisonc++04.html#PRECEDENCE">4.5.9</a>).
    </ul>
<p>
By convention, a character token is only used to represent that
particular character. Thus, the token '<code >+</code>' is represents the character
`<code >+</code>' as a token.
<p>
All common escape sequences that can be used in <strong >C++</strong>'s character
constants can be used in <strong >bisonc++</strong> as well. Be careful not to use the <code >0</code>
character as a character literal because its ASCII code, zero, is the code
<code >lex</code> returns to indicate end-of-input (see section <a href="bisonc++05.html#LEX">5.3.1</a>). If your
program <em >must</em> be able to return 0-byte characters, define a special token
(e.g., <code >ZERO_BYTE</code>) and return that token instead.
<p>
Note that <em >literal string tokens</em>, formally supported in Bison, are
<em >not</em> supported by <strong >bisonc++</strong>. Again, such tokens are hardly ever encountered, and
lexical scanner generators (like <strong >flex</strong>(1) and <strong >flexc++</strong>(1)) do not
support them. Common practice is to define a symbolic name for a literal
string token. So, a token like <code >EQ</code> may be defined in the grammar file, with
the lexical scanner returning <code >EQ</code> when it matches <code >==</code>.
<p>
The value returned by the parser's <code >lex</code> member is always a terminal
token. The numeric code for a character token is simply the ASCII code of that
character, and <code >lex</code> can simply return that character constant as a token
value. Each named token becomes a <strong >C++</strong> enumeration value in the parser base
class header file, and <code >lex</code> can return such enumeration identifiers as
well. When using an externally defined lexical scanner, that lexical scanner
should include the parser's base class header file, and it should return
either character constants or the token identifiers defined in that header
file. So, if (%token NUM) was defined in the parser class <code >Parser</code>, then the
lexical scanner may return <code >Parser::NUM</code>.
<p>
The symbol `<code >error</code>' is a reserved <em >terminal</em> symbol reserved by <strong >bisonc++</strong> for
error recovery purposes (see chapter <a href="bisonc++08.html#RECOVERY">8</a>). The <code >error</code> symbol
should not be used for other purposes. In particular, the parser's member
function <code >lex</code> should never return <code >error</code>. Several more identifiers
should not be used as terminal symbols either. See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#IMPROPER">4.5.27.1</a> for
an overview.
<p>
<a name="RULES"></a><a name="l17"></a>
<h2 >4.3: Syntax of Grammar Rules</h2>
Grammar rules have the following characteristics:
<p>
<ul>
    <li> The construction
        <pre>

    exp:    
        exp '+' exp
    ;
        
</pre>

    is a recursive rule definition, stating that when two <code >exp</code> groupings,
with a `+' token in between, have been recognized, these three elements
themselves represent an <code >exp</code> gouping.
<p>
<li> Whitespace in rules is only used for separating symbols.
<p>
<li> <em >Action blocks</em> determining the
semantics of the rule can be inserted between the elements of production
rules. An action block looks like this:
        <pre>

    {
        C++ statements
    }
        
</pre>

    Usually there is only one action block, defined at the end of production
rules . See section <a href="bisonc++04.html#ACTIONS">4.6.2</a>.
<p>
<li> Multiple production rules for the same grouping can be written
separately or can be separated from each other using the vertical-bar
character `|' as follows:
        <pre>

    result: 
        first-production-rule
    | 
        second-production-rule
    |
        ...
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
<li> Alternatively, multiple rules of the same grouping can be
defined. E.g., the previous definition of <code >result:</code> could also have been
defined as:
        <pre>

    result: 
        first-production-rule
    ;

    result:
        second-production-rule
    ;
        
</pre>

    However, this is a potentially dangerous practice, since one of the two
<code >result</code> rules could also have used a misspelled rule-name (maybe the second
<code >result</code>) should have been <code >results</code>. Therefore, <strong >bisonc++</strong> generates a warning
if the same nonterminal is used repeatedly when defining production rules.
<p>
<li> Production rules can be empty. This means that <em >result</em> can match
any token, which then isn't processed by the production rule, although the
rule's nonterminal has been recognized. Such a alternative is called an
<em >empty production rule</em>. For example, here is how to define a
comma-separated sequence of zero or more <code >exp</code> nonterminals:
        <pre>

    expseq:   
        expseq1
    | 
        // empty 
    ;

    expseq1:  
        expseq1 ',' exp
    | 
        exp
    ;
        
</pre>

    By convention, to improve the visibility of an empty production rule, it
contains the comment `<code >// empty</code>'.
<p>
Empty production rules may contain action blocks. Statements in
such action blocks are executed when the parser has recognized the empty
production rule. In such cases the <code >// empty</code> comment is omitted.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="RECURSIVE"></a><a name="l18"></a>
<h2 >4.4: Writing recursive rules</h2>
A rule is called <em >recursive</em> when its <em >result</em> nonterminal appears also in
its production rules. Nearly all <strong >bisonc++</strong> grammars use recursion, because
that is the only way to define a sequence of any number of
somethings. Consider this recursive definition of a comma-separated sequence
of one or more expressions:
        <pre>

    expseq1:  
            expseq1 ',' exp
    | 
            exp
    ;
        
</pre>

    Since the recursive use of expseq1 is the leftmost symbol in the right
hand side, we call this <em >left recursion</em>. By contrast, here the same
construct is defined using <em >right recursion</em>:
        <pre>

    expseq1:  
            exp ',' expseq1
    | 
            exp
    ;
        
</pre>

    Any kind of sequence can be defined using either left recursion or right
recursion, but whenever possible use left recursion, because it can parse a
sequence of any number of elements given a limited stack space. Right
recursion consumes stack space  proportionally  to the number of
elements in the sequence, because all elements must be pushed on the
stack before the rule can be applied even once. See chapter <a href="bisonc++07.html#ALGORITHM">7</a> for
further explanation of this phenomenon.
<p>
<em >Indirect</em> or <em >mutual</em> recursion occurs when the result of the rule does
not appear directly on its right hand side, but does appear in rules for other
nonterminals which do appear on its right hand side. For example:
        <pre>

    expr:     
        primary '+' primary
    |
        primary
        ;

    primary:  
        constant
    | 
        '(' expr ')'
    ;
        
</pre>

    defines two mutually-recursive nonterminals, since each refers to the
other.
<p>
<a name="DIRECTIVES"></a><a name="l19"></a>
<h2 >4.5: Bisonc++ Directives</h2>
The declaration section of a grammar file defines the symbols used in
formulating the production rules and the data types of semantic values. See
section <a href="bisonc++04.html#SYMBOLS">4.2</a>.
<p>
All token names (except for single-character literal tokens such as '+' and
'*') must be declared. If data types must be associated with semantic values
of symbols (see sections <a href="bisonc++04.html#SEMANTICS">4.6</a>) then those symbols must also be
declared.
<p>
By default the first rule in the rule section specifies the grammar's <em >start
symbol</em>. The <code >%start</code> directive can be used to specify another rule (see
section <a href="bisonc++03.html#LANGUAGES">3.1</a>).
<p>
This section covers all of <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s declarations. Some have already been
mentioned, but several more are available. Some define how the grammar parses
its input (like <code >%left, %right</code>); other directives define, e.g., the name of
the parsing function, or the name(s) of the files <strong >bisonc++</strong> generates.
<p>
In particular readers familiar with Bison (or Bison++) should read this
section thoroughly, since <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s directives are more extensive and different
from the `declarations' offered by Bison, and the macros defined by Bison++.
<p>
Several directives expect file- or pathname arguments. File- or pathnames must
be provided on the same line as the directive itself, starting at the first
non-blank character after the directive. File- or pathnames may contain escape
sequences (e.g., if you must: use `<code >\ </code>' to include a blank in a filename),
and continue until encountering the next blank character. Alternatively, file-
or pathnames may be surrounded by double quotes (<code >"..."</code>) or pointed
brackets (<code >&lt;...&gt;</code>). Pointed brackets surrounding file- or path-names merely
function to delimit filenames. They do not refer to, e.g., <strong >C++</strong>'s include
path. No escape sequences are required for blanks within delimited file- or
path-names.
<p>
Directives accepting a `filename' do not accept path names, i.e., they cannot
contain directory separators (<code >/</code>); directives accepting a 'pathname' may
contain directory separators.
<p>
Sometimes directives have analogous command-line options. In those cases
command-line options take priority over directives.
<p>
Some directives may generate errors. This happens when a directive
conflicts with the contents of a file <strong >bisonc++</strong> cannot modify (e.g., a
parser class header file exists, but doesn't define a namespace, but a
<code >%namespace</code> directive was provided). 
<p>
To solve such errore the offending directive could be omitted, the existing
file could be removed, or the existing file could be hand-edited according to
the directive's specification.
<p>
<a name="l20"></a>
<h3 >4.5.1: %baseclass-preinclude: specifying a header included by the
            baseclass</h3>    
         Syntax: <strong >%baseclass-preinclude</strong> <code >pathname</code>
<p>
<code >Pathname</code> defines the path to the file preincluded in the parser's
base-class header.  See the description of the
<a href="bisonc++09.html#PREINCLUDE">--baseclass-preinclude</a> option for details about this
directive.
<p>
By default `pathname' is surrounded by double quotes; but the double
quotes can also explicitly be specified.  When the argument is surrounded by
<em >pointed brackets</em> <code >#include &lt;header&gt;</code> is used.
<p>
<a name="PARSERCLASS"></a><a name="l21"></a>
<h3 >4.5.2: %class-name: defining the name of the parser class</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%class-name</strong> <code >parser-class-name</code> 
<p>
By default, <strong >bisonc++</strong> generates a parser-class using the class name 
<code >Parser</code>. The default can be changed using this directive which defines the
name of the <strong >C++</strong> class that will be generated. It may be defined only once
and <code >parser-class-name</code> must be a <strong >C++</strong> identifier.
<p>
It is an error if this directive is used and an already existing parser-class
header file does not define <code >class `className'</code> and/or if an already
existing implementation header file does not define members of the class
<code >`className'</code>.
<p>
<a name="l22"></a>
<h3 >4.5.3: %debug: adding debugging code to the `parse()' member</h3>
    Syntax:  <strong >%debug</strong> 
<p>
Provide <code >parse</code> and its support functions with debugging code,
showing the actual parsing process on the standard output
stream. 
<p>
When specified, debug output is shown by default, but its activity may be
controlled using the <code >setDebug(bool on-off)</code> or <code >setDebug(DebugMode__)</code>
members. Note that no <code >#ifdef DEBUG</code> macros are used anymore. Rerun <strong >bisonc++</strong>
without the <strong >--debug</strong> option to generate an equivalent parser not containing
the debugging code.
<p>
<a name="DEFAULTACTION"></a><a name="l23"></a>
<h3 >4.5.4: %default-actions: adding `$$ = $1' action blocks to production rules</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%default-actions</strong> <code >off|quiet|warn|std</code>
<p>
By default, production rules without final action blocks are augmented by the
<strong >bison</strong>(1) parser generator with <code >$$ = $1</code> action blocks: the semantic
value of the first component is returned as the rule's semantic value. Its
manual also states that for empty rules there is no meaningful default
action. However, it could be argued that empty production rules could return
default semantic values, resulting in every matched rule having a defined
semantic value.
<p>
When multiple semantic value types are used, the semantic value type returned
by a <code >$$ = $1</code> action is not uniquely defined. For one rule <code >$1</code> might be
an <code >int</code> field in a union, for another rule it might be a <code >std::string
*</code>. With polymorphic semantic values comparable situations are encountered.
<p>
By default, <strong >bisonc++</strong> mimics bison's behavior in that it adds a <code >$$ = $1</code> action
block to rules not having final action blocks, but not to empty production
rules. This default behavior can also explicitly be configured using the
<code >default-actions std</code> option or directive. 
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> also supports alternate ways of handling rules not having final action
blocks.  When <code >off</code> is specified, <strong >bisonc++</strong> does not add <code >$$ = $1</code> action
blocks; when polymorphic semantic values are used, then specifying
    <ul>
    <li> <code >warn</code> adds specialized action blocks, using the semantic types of
the first elements of the production rules, while issuing a warning;
    <li> <code >quiet</code> adds these action blocks without issuing warnings.
    </ul>    
When either <code >warn</code> or <code >quiet</code> are specified the types of $$ and $1 must
match. When <strong >bisonc++</strong> detects a type mismatches it issues errors. 
<p>
When polymorphic semantic values are used then the default <code >$$ = $1</code> action
probably is less useful than when, e.g., plain <code >%stype</code> semantic values are
used. After all, no semantic values are associated with <code >$$</code>. Furthermore,
once the production rule has been recognized, the production rule is reduced
to the rule's left-hand side non-terminal. Thus, <code >$1</code> ceases to exists,
immediately following the <code >$$ = $1</code> statement. Therefore, <em >if</em> default
actions are used in combination with polymorphic semantic value types they are
implemented using move-operations: <code >$$ = std::move($1)</code>. However, in this
situation default actions can frequently be suppressed, slightly improving the
efficency of the generated parser.
<p>
When a default action block can be added to a production rule and either
<code >warn</code> or <code >quiet</code> was specified,  <strong >bisonc++</strong> compares the types associated with
rule's nonterminal, and with the production rule's first element. The <code >warn</code>
and <code >quiet</code> specifications make identical decisions about the action
blocks to add, but in addition <code >warn</code> also shows a warning message that the
action block is added to the production rule.
    <ul>
    <li> If no type is associated with the rule then no default action block
        is added if no type was associated with the production rule's first
        element either; otherwise an error is issued.
    <li> If the rule's type is <code >STYPE__</code> then, if no type is associated
        with the production rule's first element it is initialized to
        <code >STYPE__</code>; otherwise it is initialized with the first element's
        semantic value.
    <li> If the rule is associated with a polymorphic tag then, if the same
        tag was associated with production rule's first element it is
        initialized with the first element's semantic value. Otherwise an
        error is issued.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l24"></a>
<h3 >4.5.5: %error-verbose: dumping the parser's state stack</h3>
    Syntax:     <strong >%error-verbose</strong>
<p>
The parser's state stack is dumped to the standard error stream when an
error is detected by the <code >parse</code> member function. After calling
<code >error</code> the stack is dumped from the top of the stack (highest
offset) down to its bottom (offset 0). Each stack element is prefixed by the
stack element's index.
<p>
<a name="EXPECT"></a><a name="l25"></a>
<h3 >4.5.6: %expect: suppressing conflict warnings</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%expect</strong> <code >number</code> 
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong> normally warns if there are any conflicts in the grammar (see section
<a href="bisonc++07.html#SHIFTREDUCE">7.1</a>), but many real grammars have harmless <em >shift/reduce
conflicts</em> which are resolved in a predictable way and which would be
difficult to eliminate. It is desirable to suppress the warning about these
conflicts unless the number of conflicts changes. You can do this with the
<code >%expect</code> declaration.
<p>
The argument <code >number</code> is a decimal integer. The declaration says there
should be no warning if there are <code >number</code> shift/reduce conflicts and no
<em >reduce/reduce conflicts</em>. The usual warning is given if there are either
<em >more</em> or <em >fewer</em> conflicts, <em >or</em> if there are <em >any</em> reduce/reduce
conflicts.
<p>
In general, using <code >%expect</code> involves these steps:
    <ul>
    <li> Compile your grammar without <code >%expect</code>. Use the `<code >-V</code>' option to
get a verbose list of where the conflicts occur. <strong >Bisonc++</strong> will also print the
number of conflicts.
    <li> Check each of the conflicts to make sure that <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s default
resolution is what you really want. If not, rewrite the grammar and go back to
the beginning.
    <li> Add an <code >%expect</code> declaration, copying the number of (shift-reduce)
conflict printed by <strong >bisonc++</strong>.
    </ul>
    Now <strong >bisonc++</strong> will stop annoying you about the conflicts you have checked, but
it will warn you again if changes in the grammar result in a different number
or type of conflicts.
<p>
<a name="l26"></a>
<h3 >4.5.7: %flex: using the traditional `flex++'  interface</h3>
    Syntax:     <strong >%flex</strong> <br/>    
<p>
When provided, the scanner matched text function is called as
<code >d_scanner.YYText()</code>, and the scanner token function is called as
<code >d_scanner.yylex()</code>. This directive is only interpreted if the <code >%scanner</code>
directive is also provided.
<p>
<a name="INCLUDE"></a><a name="l27"></a>
<h3 >4.5.8: %include: splitting the input file</h3>
    Syntax:     <strong >%include</strong> <code >pathname</code>
<p>
This directive is used to switch to <code >pathname</code> while processing a grammar
specification. Unless <code >pathname</code> defines an absolute file-path, <code >pathname</code>
is searched relative to the location of <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s main grammar specification
file (i.e., the grammar file that was specified as <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s command-line
option). This directive can be used to split long grammar specification files
in shorter, meaningful units. After processing <code >pathname</code> processing
continues beyond the <code >%include pathname</code> directive.
<p>
<strong >Bisonc++</strong>'s main grammar specification file could simply be:
        <pre>

    %include spec/declarations
    %%
    %include spec/rules
        
</pre>

    where <code >spec/declarations</code> contains declarations and <code >spec/rules</code>
contains the rules. Each of the files included using <code >%include</code> may itself
use <code >%include</code> directives (which are then processed relative to their
locations). The default nesting limit for <code >%include</code> directives is 10, but
the option <a href="bisonc++09.html#MAXDEPTH">--max-inclusion-depth</a> can be used to change this
default.
<p>
<code >%include</code> directives should be specified on their own lines, not containing
any other information.
<p>
<a name="PRECEDENCE"></a><a name="l28"></a>
<h3 >4.5.9: %left, %right, %nonassoc: defining operator
        precedence</h3>
    Syntax: <blockquote >
    <strong >%left</strong> [ &lt;type&gt; ] terminal(s)    <br/>
    <strong >%nonassoc</strong> [ &lt;type&gt; ] terminal(s)    <br/>
    <strong >%right</strong> [ &lt;type&gt; ] terminal(s) 
    </blockquote>
    These directives are called <em >precedence directives</em> (see also section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#PRECEDENCE">4.5.9</a> for general information on operator precedence).
<p>
The <code >%left</code>, <code >%right</code>, and <code >%nonassoc</code> directives are used to
declare tokens and to specify their precedence and associativity, all at once.
    <ul>
    <li> The <em >associativity</em> of an operator <code >op</code> determines how repeated
uses of the operator <em >nest</em>: whether `<code >x op y op z</code>' is parsed by combining
<code >x</code> with <code >y</code> first or by combining <code >y</code> with <code >z</code> first. <code >%left</code>
specifies <em >left-associativity</em> (combining <code >x</code> with <code >y</code> first) and
<code >%right</code> specifies <em >right-associativity</em> (combining <code >y</code> with <code >z</code>
first). <code >%nonassoc</code> specifies <em >no</em> associativity, which means that `<code >x
op y op z</code>' is not a defined operation, and could be considered an error.
    <li> The <em >precedence</em> of an operator determines how it nests in
combination with other operators. All the tokens declared in a single
precedence directive have equal precedence and nest together according to
their associativity. When two tokens declared in different precedence
directives associate, the one declared <em >later</em> has the higher precedence and
is grouped <em >first</em>.
    </ul>
    The <code >&lt;type&gt;</code> specification is optional, and specifies the type of the
semantic value when a token specified to the right of a <code >&lt;type&gt;</code>
specification is received. The pointed arrows are part of the type
specification; the type itself must be a field of a <code >%union</code> 
(see section <a href="bisonc++04.html#UNION">4.5.29</a>) or it must be a polymorphic <em >tag</em> (see section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a>).
<p>
When multiple tokens are listed they must be separated by whitespace or by
commas. Note that the precedence directives also serve to define token names:
symbolic tokens mentioned with these directives should not be defined using
<code >%token</code> directives.

<h3 >4.5.10: %locationstruct: specifying a dedicated location struct</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%locationstruct</strong> <code >struct-definition</code> 
<p>
Defines the organization of the location-struct data type <strong >LTYPE__</strong>. This
struct should be specified analogously to the way the parser's stacktype is
defined using <strong >%union</strong> (see below). The location struct type is named
<strong >LTYPE__</strong>. If neither <strong >locationstruct</strong> nor <strong >LTYPE__</strong> is specified, the
default <a href="bisonc++04.html#LSPNEEDED">LTYPE__</a> struct is used.
<p>
<a name="LSPNEEDED"></a><a name="l30"></a>
<h3 >4.5.11: %lsp-needed: using the default location type</h3>
    Syntax:  <strong >%lsp-needed</strong>
<p>
When this directive is specified the standard location stack is added to the
generated parser class.  The standard location type (defined in the parser's
base class) is equal to the following struct:
           <pre>

    struct LTYPE__
    {
        int timestamp;
        int first_line;
        int first_column;
        int last_line;
        int last_column;
        char *text;
    };
           
</pre>

    Note that defining this struct type does not imply that its field are also
assigned. Some form of communication with the lexical scanner is probably
required to initialize the fields of this struct properly. 
<p>
<a name="LTYPE"></a><a name="l31"></a>
<h3 >4.5.12: %ltype: using an existing location type</h3>
     <strong >%ltype typename</strong> 
<p>
Specifies a user-defined token location type.  If <strong >%ltype</strong> is used,
<code >typename</code> should be the name of an alternate default-constructible type
(e.g., <strong >size_t</strong>). It should not be used together with a
<a href="bisonc++04.html#LOCSTRUCT">%locationstruct</a> specification. From inside the parser class,
this type may be referred to as <strong >LTYPE__</strong>.
<p>
Any text following <code >%ltype</code> up to the end of the line, up to the first
of a series of trailing blanks or tabs or up to a comment-token (<code >//</code> or
<code >/*</code>) becomes part of the type definition. Be sure <em >not</em> to end an
<code >%ltype</code> definition in a semicolon.
<p>
<a name="l32"></a>
<h3 >4.5.13: %namespace: using a namespace</h3>
    Syntax:     <strong >%namespace</strong> <code >namespace</code> 
<p>
Defines all of the code generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong> in the namespace
<code >namespace</code>. By default no namespace is defined.
<p>
If this options is used the implementation header will contain a commented
out <code >using namespace</code> directive for the requested namespace.
<p>
In addition, the parser and parser base class header files also use the
specified namespace to define their include guard directives.
<p>
It is an error to use this directive while an already existing parser-class
header file and/or implementation header file does not specify <code >namespace
identifier</code>.

<a name="l33"></a>
<h3 >4.5.14: %negative-dollar-indices: using constructions like $-1</h3>
    Syntax:    <strong >%negative-dollar-indices</strong> 
<p>
Accept (do not generate warnings) zero- or negative dollar-indices in the
grammar's action blocks. Zero or negative dollar-indices are commonly used to
implement inherited attributes and should normally be avoided. When used they
can be specified like <code >$-1</code>, or like <code >$&lt;type&gt;-1</code>, where <code >type</code> is an
<code >STYPE__</code> tag; or a <code >%union</code> field-name. See also sections <a href="bisonc++04.html#ACTIONS">4.6.2</a>,

<a name="l34"></a>
<h3 >4.5.15: %no-lines: suppressing `#line' directives</h3>
    Syntax:    <strong >%no-lines</strong> 
<p>
Do not put <strong >#line</strong> preprocessor directives in the file containing the
parser's <code >parse</code> function. By default <code >#line</code> preprocessor directives
are inserted just before action blocks in the generated <code >parse.cc</code> file.
<p>
The <code >#line</code> directives allow compilers and debuggers to associate errors
with lines in your grammar specification file, rather than with the source
file containing the <code >parse</code> function itself.

<a name="l35"></a>
<h3 >4.5.16: %prec: overruling default precedences</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%prec</strong> <code >token</code> 
<p>
The construction <strong >%prec</strong> <code >token</code> may be used in production rules to
overrule the actual precedence of an operator in a particular production
rule. Well known is the construction
                <pre>

    expression:
        '-' expression %prec UMINUS
        {
            ...
        }
                
</pre>
 
    Here, the default precedence and precedence of the <code >`-'</code> token as the
subtraction operator is overruled by the precedence and precedence of the
<code >UMINUS</code> token, which is frequently defined as:
                <pre>

    %right UMINUS
                
</pre>

    E.g., a list of arithmetic operators could consists of:
        <pre>

    %left '+' '-'
    %left '*' '/' '%'
    %right UMINUS
        
</pre>

    giving <code >* /</code> and <code >%</code> a higher precedence than <code >+</code> and <code >-</code>,
ensuring at the same time that <code >UMINUS</code> is given both the highest precedence
and a right-associativity.
<p>
In the above production rule the operator order would result in the
construction 
        <pre>

    '-' expression
        
</pre>

    being evaluated from right to left, having a higher precedence than either
the multiplication or the addition operators.
<p>
The <code >%prec</code> directive associates priorities to rules. These priorities are
interpreted whenever there are (shift-reduce) conflicts. If there are no
conflicts, priorities are not required, and are ignored.
<p>
When the parser analyzes the above grammar, a conflict <em >is</em>
encountered. Consider the following simple grammar, in which only the minus
(<code >'-'</code>) operator is used, albeit in beinary and unary form:
<p>
<pre>

    %token NR
    %left '-'
    %right UNARY

    expr:
        NR
    |
        expr '-' expr
    |
        '-' expr %prec UNARY
    ;
        
</pre>

    When analuzing this grammar, <strong >bisonc++</strong> defines <em >states</em> (cf. chapter
<a href="bisonc++07.html#ALGORITHM">7</a>) defining what to do when encountering certain input
tokens. Each possibility is defined by an <em >item</em>, in which a dot (<code >.</code>) is
commonly used to show to which point a production rule has been
recognized. For the above grammar one such state looks like this:
        <pre>

    0: expr -&gt; '-' expr  .        { '-' &lt;EOF&gt; }
    1: expr -&gt; expr  . '-' expr
        
</pre>

    The elements between parentheses define the <em >look-ahead</em> tokens: the
token that may appear next for <em >reducible</em> rules. Item 0 is such a reducible
rule, and it is used to reduce <code >'-' expr</code> to an expression (<code >expr</code>).
<p>
The second item shows the production rule defining the binary minus
operator. Its left-hand side expression has been recognized, and the parser
expects to see a minus operator next. 
<p>
The conflict is caused by the expected minus operator in item 1, and a
minus operator that may follow item 0. As there is only one look-ahead symbol
(since <strong >bisonc++</strong> can only handle LALR(1) grammars) the grammer contains a
shift-reduce conflict: shift, and continue with item 1; or reduce, and
continue with item 0. In this case, <code >%prec</code> solves the issue, by giving item
0 a higher precedence than item 1 (whose precedence is equal to the precedence
of its first terminal token, which is the binary minus operator's
precedence). 
<p>
Although never encountered in real life, it's also possible to give the
unary minus operator a <em >lower</em> priority than the binary minus operator. The
grammar, in this case, looks like this:
        <pre>

    %token NR
    %right UNARY
    %left '-'

    expr:
        NR
    |
        expr '-' expr
    |
        '-' expr %prec UNARY
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
With this grammar we encounter a state with these two items:
        <pre>

    0:  expr -&gt; '-' expr  .   { &lt;EOF&gt; } 
    1:  expr -&gt; expr  . '-' expr
        
</pre>

    Here, the conflict no longer manifests itself, as the minus operator no
longer appears in item 0's look-ahead set. The resulting parser will, when
encountering a minus, shift the minus, and proceed according to item 1, and
when anything else is encountered reduce the <code >'-' expr</code> production to
<code >expr</code>. In real life this means that an expression like <code >-4 - 3</code>
evaluates to -1. 
<p>
To illustrate a situation where <code >%prec</code> won't work consider this
grammar: 
        <pre>

    %token NR
    %left '-'
    %right POSTFIX

    expr:
        NR
    |
        expr '-' expr
    |
        expr '-' %prec POSTFIX
    ;
        
</pre>

    When this grammar is analyzed the following state is encountered:
        <pre>

    0:  expr -&gt; expr '-'  . expr   
    1:  expr -&gt; expr '-'  .         { '-' &lt;EOF&gt; }
    2:  expr -&gt;  . NR   
    3:  expr -&gt;  . expr '-' expr   
    4:  expr -&gt;  . expr '-'   
      
</pre>

    To appreciate why <code >%prec</code> doesn't work here, consider the various
look-ahead tokens. For items 0, 3, and 4 the look-ahead token is the
non-terminal <code >expr</code>; for item 2 the look-ahead token is the terminal <code >NR</code>,
and for item 1, handling the postfix minus operator, it is a minus
character. Thus, there  isn't any conflict between the shiftable items and the
reducible item 1, and consequently the <code >%prec</code> specification isn't
used. Any attempt to define a grammar handling a postfix minus operator will
fail. A common solution consists of defining a separate operator, explicitly
giving it its appropriate priority and associativity. E.g.,
        <pre>

    %token NR
    %left '-'
    %right '_'  // underscore

    expr:
        NR
    |
        expr '-' expr
    |
        expr '_'    // underscore as postfix minus
    ;
        
</pre>

<h3 >4.5.17: %polymorphic: using polymorphism to define multiple semantic
            values</h3> 
        Syntax: <strong >%polymorphic</strong> <code >polymorphic-specification(s)</code>
<p>
The <code >%polymorphic</code> directive is used to define a polymorphic semantic value
class, offering a (preferred) alternative to (traditional) <code >union</code> types.
<p>
Refer to section <a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a> for a detailed description of the
specification, characteristics, and use of polymorphic semantic values.
<p>
As a quick reference: to define multiple semantic values using a polymorphic
semantic value class offering either an <code >int</code>, a <code >std::string</code> or a
<code >std::vector&lt;double&gt;</code> specify:
                <pre>

    %polymorphic INT: int; STRING: std::string; 
                 VECT: std::vector&lt;double&gt;
                
</pre>

    and use <code >%type</code> specifications (cf. section <a href="bisonc++04.html#TYPE">4.5.28</a>) to associate
(non-)terminals with specific semantic value types.
<p>
<code >%stype, %union</code> and <code >%polymorphic</code> are mutually exclusive: only one
of these directives can be used.  
<p>
<a name="l37"></a>
<h3 >4.5.18: %print-tokens: displaying tokens and matched text</h3> 
    Syntax: <strong >%print-tokens</strong> 
<p>
The <code >%print-tokens</code> directive provides an implementation of the Parser
class's <code >print__</code> function displaying the current token value and the text
matched by the lexical scanner as received by the generated <code >parse</code>
function.
<p>
The <code >print__</code> function is also implemented if the <code >--print</code>
command-line option is provided.
<p>
<a name="l38"></a>
<h3 >4.5.19: %required-tokens: defining the minimum number of tokens between
        error reports</h3> 
    Syntax:    <strong >%required-tokens</strong> <code >ntokens</code> 
<p>
Whenever a syntactic error is detected during the parsing process
subsequent  tokens received by the parsing function may easily cause yet
another (spurious) syntactic error. In this situation error recovery in fact
produces an avalanche of additional errors. If this happens the recovery
process may benefit from a slight modification. Rather than reporting every
syntactic error encountered by the parsing function, the parsing function may
wait for a series of successfully processed tokens before reporting the next
error. 
<p>
The directive <code >%required-tokens</code> can be used to specify this
number. E.g., the specification <code >%required-tokens 10</code> requires the parsing
function to process successfully a series of 10 tokens before another
syntactic error is reported (and counted). If a syntactic error is encountered
before processing 10 tokens then the counter counting the number of
successfully processed tokens is reset to zero, no error is reported, but the
error recoery procedure continues as usual. The number of required tokens can
also be set using the option <a href="bisonc++09.html#REQUIRED">--required-tokens</a>. By default the
number of required tokens is initialized to 0.

<h3 >4.5.20: %scanner: using a standard scanner interface</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%scanner</strong> <code >header</code>
<p>
Use <code >header</code> as the pathname of a file to include in the parser's class
header file. See the description of the <a href="bisonc++09.html#SCANOPT">--scanner</a> option for
details about this directive.  When this directive is used a <code >Scanner
d_scanner</code> data member is automatically included in the generated parser,
while the predefined <strong >int lex()</strong> member is simply returning
<code >d_scanner.lex()</code>'s return value.  When, in addition to the <code >%scanner</code>
directive the <code >%flex</code> directive was also specified then the function
<code >d_scanner.YYText()</code> is called.
<p>
Unless double quotes or angular brackets were explixity used, the specified
<code >header</code> file will be surrounded by double quotes.
<p>
It is an error to use this directive in combination with an already existing
parser-class header not including `<code >header</code>'.
<p>
<a name="l40"></a>
<h3 >4.5.21: %scanner-matched-text-function: define the name of the scanner's
        member returning the matched texttoken</h3> 
    Syntax: <strong >%scanner-matched-text-function</strong> <code >function-call</code> <br/>
<p>
The <code >%scanner-matched-text-function</code> directive defines the scanner function
that must be called to obtain the text matching the most recently returned
token. By default this is <code >d_scanner.matched()</code>.
<p>
A complete function call expression should be provided (including a scanner
object, if applicable). This option overrules the <code >d_scanner.matched()</code> call
used by default when the <code >%scanner</code> directive is specified. Example:
            <pre>

    %scanner-matched-text-function myScanner.matchedText()
                
</pre>

    If the function call expression contains white space then the
<code >function-call</code> specification must be surrounded by double quotes (<code >"</code>).
<p>
Note that an expression is expected, not an expression <em >statement</em>: do not
include a final semicolon in the specification.
<p>
<a name="l41"></a>
<h3 >4.5.22: %scanner-token-function: define the name of the scanner's token
            function</h3> 
    Syntax: <strong >%scanner-token-function</strong> <code >function-call</code> <br/>
<p>
This directive is used to specify how to call the scanner function returning
the next token from the parser's <code >lex</code> function. A complete function call
expression should be provided (including a scanner object, if
applicable). Example:
            <pre>

    %scanner-token-function d_scanner.lex()
                
</pre>

    If the function call contains white space then the function call
specification must be surrounded by double quotes.
<p>
It is an error to use  this directive in combination with an already existing
internal header file (.ih file) in which the specified function is not called.
<p>
Note that an expression is expected, not an expression <em >statement</em>: do not
include a final semicolon in the specification.

<h3 >4.5.23: %stack-expansion: the number of elements added to the semantic
                                value stack</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%stack-expansion</strong> <code >size</code>
<p>
Defines the number of elements to be added to the generated parser's semantic
value stack when it must be enlarged. By default 10 elements are added to the
stack. This option/directive is interpreted only once, and only if <code >size</code> at
least equals the default stack expansion size of 10.
<p>
<a name="l43"></a>
<h3 >4.5.24: %start: defining the start rule</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%start</strong> <code >nonterminal symbol</code>
<p>
By default <strong >bisonc++</strong> uses the nonterminal that is defined by the first rule in a
grammar specification file as the start symbol. I.e., the parser tries to
recognize that nonterminal when parsing input.
<p>
This default behavior may be modified using the <code >%start</code> directive.
    The nonterminal symbol specifies a nonterminal that may be defined
anywhere in the rules section of the grammar specification file. This
nonterminal then 
becomes the grammar's start symbol.
<p>
<a name="STYPE"></a><a name="l44"></a>
<h3 >4.5.25: %stype: defining a single semantic value type</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%stype typename</strong> <br/>    
<p>
This directive defines the type of the semantic value of tokens.  The
specified type must be a default constructible type, like <code >size_t</code> or
<code >std::string</code>. By default, <strong >bisonc++</strong> uses <code >int</code> for the semantic value type of
its parser's tokens. To use another single semantic value type , this
directive must be used.
<p>
In programs using a simple grammar it may be sufficient to use the same data
type for the semantic values of all language constructs (see, e.g., sections
<a href="bisonc++06.html#RPN">6.1</a> and <a href="bisonc++06.html#CALC">6.2</a>).
<p>
Any text following <code >%stype</code> up to the end of the line, up to the first
of a series of trailing blanks or tabs or up to a comment-token (<code >//</code> or
<code >/*</code>) becomes part of the type definition. Be sure <em >not</em> to end a
<code >%stype</code> definition in a semicolon.
<p>
<code >%stype, %union</code> and <code >%polymorphic</code> are mutually exclusive: only one
of these directives can be used.  
<p>
Sources including the generated parser class header file should refer to the
semantic value typename as <strong >STYPE__</strong>.
<p>
<a name="l45"></a>
<h3 >4.5.26: %tag-mismatches: check for tag-mismatches with polymorphic
        semantic values</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%tag-mismatches</strong> <code >on|off</code>
<p>
This directive is only interpreted when polymorphic semantic values are
used. When <code >on</code> is specified (which is used by default) the <code >parse</code> member
of the generated parser dynamically checks that the tag used when calling a
semantic value's <code >get</code> member matches the actual tag of the semantic value.
<p>
If a mismatch is observed, then the parsing function aborts after displaying a
fatal error message. If this happens, and if the option/directive <code >debug</code>
was specified when <strong >bisonc++</strong> created the parser's parsing function, then the
program can be rerun, specifying <code >parser.setDebug(Parser::ACTIONCASES)</code>
before calling the parsing function. As a result the case-entry numbers of the
<code >switch</code>, defined in the parser's <code >executeAction</code> member, are inserted
into the standard output stream. The action case number reported just before
the program displays the fatal error message tells you in which of the
grammar's action block the error was encountered.

    <strong >%token</strong> <code >terminal token(s)</code> <br/>
    <strong >%token</strong> [ &lt;type&gt; ] <code >terminal token(s)</code> 
        </blockquote>
<p>
The <strong >%token</strong> directive is used to define one or more symbolic terminal
tokens.  When multiple tokens are listed they must be separated by whitespace
or by commas. 
<p>
The <code >&lt;type&gt;</code> specification is optional, and specifies the type of the
semantic value when receiving one of the subsequently named tokens is
received. The pointed arrows are part of the type specification; the type
itself must be a field of a <code >%union</code> specification (see section <a href="bisonc++04.html#UNION">4.5.29</a>)
or a tag defined at the <code >%polymorphic</code> directive (see section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a>).
<p>
<strong >bisonc++</strong> converts symbolic tokens (including those defined by the
precedence directives (cf. section <a href="bisonc++04.html#PRECEDENCE">4.5.9</a>)) into <code >Parser::Tokens</code>
enumeration values (see section <a href="bisonc++04.html#PARSERCLASS">4.5.2</a>). This allows the lexical
scanner to return named tokens directly as <code >Parser::name</code>.
<p>
The enumeration containing the token names is defined in <code >Parserbase.h</code>,
the parser's base class header file. So externally defined lexical scanners
can include that header file to have access to those enumeration values. 
Token names can be returned as <code >Parser::name</code>: it's not necessary to
refer to token names as <code >ParserBase::name</code>.
<p>
<a name="IMPROPER"></a><a name="l47"></a>
<h4 >4.5.27.1: Improper token names</h4>
        Several identifiers cannot be used as token names as their use would collide
with identifiers that are defined in the parser's base class. 
<p>
In particular, 
    <ul>
    <li> no token should end in two underscores (<code >__</code>). 
    <li> some identifiers are reserved and cannot be used as tokens. They are:
        <pre>

    ABORT, ACCEPT, ERROR, clearin, debug, error, setDebug
        
</pre>

    Except for <code >error</code>, which is a predefined terminal token, these
identifiers are traditionally used names of functions in the parser class
defined by <strong >bisonc++</strong>.

<h3 >4.5.28: %type: associating semantic values with (non)terminals</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%type</strong> <code >&lt;type&gt; symbol-list</code>
<p>
To associate (non-)terminals with specific semantic value types
the <strong >%type</strong> directive is used.
<p>
When <code >%polymorphic</code> is used to specify multiple semantic value types,
(non-)terminals can be associated with one of the semantic value types
specified with the <code >%polymorphic</code> directive.
<p>
When <code >%union</code> is used to specify multiple semantic value types,
(non-)terminals can be associated with one of the <code >union</code> fields specified
with the <code >%union</code> directive.
<p>
With this directive, <code >symbol-list</code> defines of one or more blank or comma
delimited grammatical symbols (i.e., terminal and/or nonterminal symbols);
<code >type</code> is either a polymorphic type-identifier or a field name defined in
the <code >%union</code> specification. The specified nonterminal(s) are automatically
associated with the indicate semantic type. The pointed arrows are part of the
type specification.
<p>
When the semantic value type of a terminal symbol is defined the
<em >lexical scanner</em> rather than the parser's actions must assign the
appropriate semantic value to <a href="bisonc++05.html#DVAL">d_val__</a> just prior to returning the
token. To associate terminal symbols with semantic values, terminal symbols
can also be specified in a <code >%type</code> directive.

<a name="UNION"></a><a name="l49"></a>
<h3 >4.5.29: %union: using a 'union' to define multiple semantic values</h3> 
        Syntax: <strong >%union</strong> <code >union-definition body</code>
<p>
In the grammars of many programs different types of data are used for different
terminal and nonterminal tokens. For example, a numeric constant may
need type <code >int</code> or <code >double</code>, while a string needs type <code >std::string</code>,
and an identifier might need a pointer to an entry in a symbol table.
<p>
Traditionally, the <code >%union</code> directive has always been used to accomplish
this. The directive defines a <strong >C</strong> union-type whose fields specify one or
more data types for semantic values. The directive <code >%union</code> is followed by a
pair of braces containing one or more field definitions. For example:
        <pre>

    %union {
      double u_val;
      symrec *u_tptr;
    };
        
</pre>

    In this example the two fields represent a <code >double</code> and a <code >symrec
*</code>. The associated field names are <code >u_val</code> and <code >u_tptr</code>, which are used in
the <code >%token</code> and <code >%type</code> directives to specify  types that are associated
with terminal or nonterminal symbols (see section <a href="bisonc++04.html#TYPE">4.5.28</a>).
<p>
Notes:
    <ul>
    <li> The semicolon following the closing brace is <em >optional</em>.
    <li> Since <strong >C++-11</strong> class types can be used in <code >union</code>
        definitions; they can also be used when defining <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s <code >%union</code>
        directives. When a class type variant is required, all required
        constructors, the destructor and other members (like overloaded
        assignment operators) must be able to handle the actual class type
        data fields properly. A discussion of how to use unrestricted unions
        is beyon this manual's scope, but can be found, e.g., in the <a href="http://cppannotations.sf.net">C++
        Annotations</a>. See also section
        <a href="bisonc++04.html#SEMANTICS">4.6</a>. 
    <li> The <code >%union</code> directive is also a bit of an anachronism. In many
        situations using <code >%polymorphic</code> is more attractive than using
        <code >%union</code> (cf. section <a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a>).
    </ul>
<p>
Although the <code >%union</code> directive is still supported by <strong >bisonc++</strong>, its use is
largely superseded by the newer <code >%polymorphic</code> directive, allowing <strong >bisonc++</strong> and
the <strong >C++</strong> compiler to verify that the correct types are used when semantic
values are assigned or retrieved, which, in turn, helps preventing run-time
errors.
<p>
<code >%stype, %union</code> and <code >%polymorphic</code> are mutually exclusive: only one
of these directives can be used.  
<p>
<a name="l50"></a>
<h3 >4.5.30: %weak-tags: %polymorphic declaring 'enum Tag__'</h3>
    Syntax: <strong >%weak-tags</strong>
<p>
By default, the <code >%polymorphic</code> directive declares a strongly typed enum:
<code >enum class Tag__</code>, and code generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong> always uses the <code >Tag__</code>
scope when referring to tag identifiers. It is often possible (by
pre-associating tokens with tags, using <code >%type</code> directives) to avoid 
the use of tags in user-code.
<p>
If tags <em >are</em> explicitly used, then they must be prefixed with the <code >Tag__</code>
scope. Before the arrival of the C++-11 standard strongly typed enumerations
didn't exist, and explicit enum-type scope prefixes were usually omitted.
<p>
The <code >%weak-tags</code> directive can be specified when the <code >Tag__</code> enum should
<em >not</em> be declared as a strongly typed enum. This directive should not be
used, unless you know what you're doing.
<p>

<h2 >4.6: The Meaning Of Things: Semantics</h2>
A language's grammar rules define its syntax. Its semantics are defined
through semantic values that can be associated with terminal and nonterminal
symbols, and generally by the actions taken when nonterminals or parts of
production rules have been recognized.
<p>
For example, the calculator performs real-life calculations because the value
associated with each expression is its computed numeric value; it correcly
performs addition because the action for an expression like `x + y' is to add
those numbers and to return their sum.
<p>
Two ways of defining semantics have already been discussed:
    <ul>
    <li> <a href="bisonc++04.html#STYPE">using a single data type for all semantic
        values</a>;
    <li> Semantic values representing <a href="bisonc++04.html#UNION">several alternative data
        types</a>.
    </ul>
<p>
A third way for defining semantic values is discussed next (cf. section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a>). <em >Shorthand notations</em> that can be used in action blocks
are described next (cf. section <code >ACTIONS</code>). Finally, Action blocks usually
appear at the end of production rules. But in fact they can be defined
anywhere in production rules. Refer to this section's final subsection
(section <a href="bisonc++04.html#MIDACTIONS">4.6.2.4</a>) for the characteristics of such <em >mid-rule action
blocks</em>.
<p>
<a name="POLYMORPHIC"></a><a name="l59"></a>
<h3 >4.6.1: Polymorphism and Multiple Semantic Values:
                        `%polymorphic'</h3> 
    <strong >Bisonc++</strong> also supports <em >polymorphic semantic values</em>. Polymorphic semantic
values were developed as an alternative to using unions. Traditional unions
can still be used, but are now considered somewhat `old school'. Polymorphic
semantic values were added to <strong >bisonc++</strong> as the result of a suggestion originally
made by Dallas A. Clement in September 2007.
<p>
In this section a simple example program is developed illustrating the use of
polymorphic semantic values.  The sources of the example can be retrieved from
the distribution's <a href="poly">poly</a> directory.
<p>
One may wonder why a <code >union</code> is still used by <strong >bisonc++</strong> as <strong >C++</strong> offers
inherently superior approaches to combine multiple types into one union
type. The <strong >C++</strong> way to do so is by defining a polymorphic base class and a
series of derived classes implementing the various exclusive data types. The
<code >union</code> approach is still supported by <strong >bisonc++</strong>, mainly for historic reasons as
it is supported by <strong >bison</strong>(1) and <strong >bison++</strong>; dropping the <code >union</code> would
needlessly impede backward compatibility.
<p>
The preferred alternative to a <code >union</code>, however, is a polymorphic base
class. The example program (cf. <a href="poly">poly</a>) uses a polymorphic semantic value
type, supporting either <code >int</code> or <code >std::string</code> semantic values. These
types are asociated with tags (resp. <code >INT</code> and <code >TEXT</code>) using the
<code >%polymorphic</code> directive, discussed next.
<p>
<a name="l60"></a>
<h4 >4.6.1.1: The %polymorphic directive</h4>
            Specifying the <code >%polymorphic</code> directive results in a parser using
polymorphic semantic values. Polymorphic semantic value specifications
consist of a <em >tag</em>, which is a <strong >C++</strong> identifier, and a <strong >C++</strong> type
definition.
<p>
Tags and type definitions are separated by colons, and multiple semantic
value specifications are separated by semicolons. The semicolon trailing the
final semantic value specification is optional.
<p>
The <code >%polymorphic</code> directive may be specified only once, and the
<code >%polymorphic, %stype</code> and <code >%union</code> directives are mutually exclusive.
<p>
Here is an example, defining three semantic values types: <code >int</code>, 
<code >std::string</code> and <code >std::vector&lt;double&gt;</code>:
        <pre>

    %polymorphic INT: int; STRING: std::string; 
                 VECT: std::vector&lt;double&gt;
        
</pre>

    The identifier to the left of the colon is called the <em >type-tag</em> (or
simply `<em >tag</em>'), and the type definition to the right of the colon is called
the <em >type-definition</em>. Types specified at the <code >%polymorphic</code>
type-definitions must be built-in types or class-type declarations. Since
<strong >bisonc++</strong> version 4.12.00 the types no longer have to be default-constructible.
<p>
As the parser's generic semantic value type is called <code >STYPE__</code>, and as
functions called by the parser may return <code >STYPE__</code> values and may expect
<code >STYPE__</code> arguments, grammar symbols can also be associated with the generic
<code >STYPE__</code> semantic type using <code >%type &lt;STYPE__&gt;</code> directives.
<p>
To prevent ambiguities the generic <code >STYPE__</code> type cannot be specified as a
polymorphic type. E.g., a specification like <code >GENERIC: STYPE__</code> cannot be
used when defining the tag/type pairs at the <code >%polymorphic</code>
directive.                
<p>
When polymorphic type-names refer to types that have not yet been declared
by the parser's base class header, then these types must be declared in a
separate header file, included into the parser's base class header file
through the <code >%baseclass-preinclude</code> directive.
<p>
<a name="l61"></a>
<h4 >4.6.1.2: Code generated by %polymorphic</h4>
        When polymorphic semantic values are used then, in addition to the parser and
parse-base classes, several more classes are defined. Some of them are class
templates; most are defined in <code >parserbase.h</code>; an occasional implementation
is added to the <code >parse.cc</code> source file.
<p>
To minimize namespace pollution most of the extra code is contained in a
namespace of its own: <code >Meta__</code>. If the <code >%namespace</code> directive was used
then <code >Meta__</code> is nested under the namespace declared by that directive. The
name <code >Meta__</code> provides a hint to the fact that much of the code implementing
polymorphic semantic values uses template meta programming.
<p>
<strong >The enumeration 'enum class Tag__'</strong>
<p>
One notable exception to the above is the enumeration <code >Tag__</code>. To simplify
its use it is declared outside of <code >Meta__</code> (but inside the <code >%namespace</code>
namespace, if specified). Its tags are declared at the <code >%polymorphic</code>
directive. <code >Targs__</code> is a strongly typed enumeration. The <code >%weak-tags</code>
directive can be used to declare a pre C++-11 standard `<code >enum Tag__</code>'.
<p>
<strong >The namespace Meta__</strong>
<p>
Below, <code >DataType</code> refers to the semantic value's data type that is
associated with a <code >Tag__</code> identifier.
<p>
Several classes are defined in the namespace <code >Meta__</code>. The most important
class is <code >SType</code>, providing the interface to the semantic value
types. The class <code >SType</code> becomes the parser's <code >STYPE__</code> type. Each
<code >SType</code> object is either a default <code >SType</code> object, not containing a
semantic value, or it contains a semantic value of a single <code >DataType</code>.  All
operations related to semantic values are handled by this class.
<p>
The class <code >SType</code> provides the following public interface:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li> Constructors: 
       Default, copy and move constructors. No data can be retrieved from
        <code >SType</code> objects that were constructed by <code >SType</code>'s default
        constructors, but they can accept values of defined polymorphic types,
        which may then be retrieved from those objects.
<p>
<li> Operators:
       The standard overloaded assignment operators (copy and move assignment
        operators) are available.
<p>
In addition the member templates 
    <pre>

    SType &amp;operator=(Type const &amp;value)
and 
    SType &amp;operator=(Type &amp;&amp;tmp)
    
</pre>

       can be used for all polymorphic semantic value types. <code >Type</code> must
        (maybe after casting) exactly match one of the defined polymorphic
        semantic types, because <code >Type</code> is used to determine the appropriate
        <code >Meta__::Tag__</code> value.
<p>
When <code >operator=(Type const &amp;value)</code> is used, the left-hand side
        <code >SType</code> object receives a copy of <code >value</code>; when <code >operator=(Type
        &amp;&amp;tmp)</code> is used, <code >tmp</code> is move-assigned to the left-hand side 
        <code >SType</code> object;
<p>
<li> <code >void assign&lt;tag&gt;(Args &amp;&amp;...args)</code> 
       The <code >tag</code> template argument must be a <code >Tag__</code> value. This member
        function constructs a semantic value of the type matching <code >tag</code> from
        the arguments that are passed to this member (zero arguments are OK if
        the type associated with <code >tag</code> supports default construction). The
        constructed value (not a copy of this value) is then stored in the
        <code >STYPE__</code> object for which <code >assign</code> has been called.
<p>
As a <code >Meta__::Tag__</code> value must be specified when using <code >assign</code>
        the compiler can use the explicit tag to convert <code >assign's</code> arguments
        to an <code >SType</code> object of the type matching the specified tag.
<p>
The member <code >assign</code> can be used to store a specific polymorphic
        semantic value in an <code >STYPE__</code> object. It differs from the set of
        <code >operator=(Type)</code> members in that <code >assign</code> accepts multiple
        arguments to construct the requested <code >SType</code> value from, whereas the
        <code >operator=</code> members only accept single arguments of defined
        polymorphic types.
<p>
To initialize an <code >STYPE__</code> object with a default <code >STYPE__</code> value,
        direct assignment can be used (e.g., <code >d_lval__ = STYPE__{}</code>).
<p>
<li> <code >DataType &amp;get&lt;tag&gt;()</code>, and <code >DataType const &amp;get&lt;tag&gt;() const</code>
       These members return references to the object's semantic values. The
        <code >tag</code> must be a <code >Tag__</code> value: its specification tells the
        compiler which semantic value type it must use.
<p>
When the option/directive <code >tag-mismatches on</code> was specified then
        <code >get</code>, when called from the generated <code >parse</code> function, performs a
        run-time check to confirm that the specified tag corresponds to
        object's actual <code >Tag__</code> value. If a mismatch is observed, then the
        parsing function aborts with a fatal error message. When 
        shorthand notations (like <code >$$</code> and <code >$1</code>) are used in production
        rules' action blocks, then <strong >bisonc++</strong> can determine the correct <code >tag</code>,
        preventing the run-time check from failing.
<p>
But once a fatal error <em >is</em> encountered, it can be difficult to
        determine which action block generated the error. If this happens,
        then consider regenerating the parser specifying the <code >--debug</code>
        option, calling
       <pre>
parser.setDebug(Parser::ACTIONCASES)
</pre>
 
       before calling the parser's <code >parse</code> function. 
<p>
Following this the case-entry numbers of the <code >switch</code> which is
        defined in the parser's <code >executeAction</code> member are inserted into the
        standard output stream just before the matching statements are
        executed. The action case number that's reported just before the
        program reports the fatal error tells you in which of the grammar's
        action block the error was encountered.
<p>
<li> <code >Tag__ tag() const</code>
       The tag matching the semantic value's polymorphic type is returned. The
        returned value is a valid <code >Tag__</code> value when the <code >SType</code> object's
        <code >valid</code> member returns <code >true</code>;
<p>
By default, or after assigning a plain (default) <code >STYPE__</code> object to
        an <code >STYPE__</code> object (e.g., using a statement like <code >$$ =
        STYPE__{}</code>), <code >valid</code> returns <code >false</code>, and the <code >tag</code> member
        returns <code >Meta__::sizeofTag__</code>.
<p>
<li> <code >bool valid() const</code> 
<p>
The value <code >true</code> is returned if the object contains a semantic
        value. Otherwise <code >false</code> is returned. Note that default <code >STYPE__</code>
        values can be assigned to <code >STYPE__</code> objects, but they do not
        represent valid semantic values. See also the previous description of
        the <code >tag</code> member.
   </ul>
<p>
<a name="l62"></a>
<h4 >4.6.1.3: A parser using a polymorphic semantic value type</h4>
        In this section a small demo-parser is developed using polymorphic semantic
values.  Its <code >%polymorphic</code> directive looks like this:
        <pre>

    %polymorphic INT: int; TEXT: std::string;
        
</pre>

    Furthermore, the grammar declares tokens <code >INT</code> and <code >IDENTIFIER</code>, and
pre-associates the <code >TEXT</code> tag with the <code >identifier</code> nonterminal,
associates the <code >INT</code> tag with the <code >int</code> nonterminal. The <code >combi</code>
nonterminal is associated with the generic <code >STYPE__</code> semantic value type:
        <pre>

    %type &lt;TEXT&gt;    identifier
    %type &lt;INT&gt;     int
    %type &lt;STYPE__&gt; combi
        
</pre>

<p>
The parser's grammar is simple, expecting input lines, formatted
according to the following (<code >rule</code>) production rule:
        <pre>

    rule:
        identifier '(' identifier ')' '\n'
    |
        identifier '=' int '\n'
    |
        combi '\n'
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
The rules for <code >identifier</code> and <code >int</code> return, respectively, text and an
<code >int</code> value:
        <pre>

    identifier:
        IDENTIFIER
        {
            $$ = d_scanner.matched();
        }
    ;
    int:
        INT
        {
            $$ = d_scanner.intValue();
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
These simple assignments can be used as <code >int</code> is pre-associated with the
<code >INT</code> tag and <code >identifier</code> is asociated with the <code >TEXT</code> tag. 
<p>
The <code >combi</code> rule, which is used in one of the production rules of
`<code >rule</code>', accepts a single <code >int</code> value, as well as an identifier. So it
cannot be associated with a single polymorphic type. But as it is associated
with the generic <code >STYPE__</code> type, it can pass on any polymorphic value. In
<code >rule's</code> production rule the generic semantic value is then simply passed on
to <code >process</code>, expecting a plain <code >STYPE__ const &amp;</code>. The function
<code >process</code> has to inspect the semantic value's tag to learn what
kind of value is stored inside the received semantic value. Here are the
definition of the <code >combi</code> nonterminal and action blocks for the <code >rule</code>
nonterminal:
        <pre>

    combi:          
        int
    |
        identifier
    ;
        
    rule:
        identifier '(' identifier ')' '\n'
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; $1 &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; $3 &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
    |
        identifier '=' int '\n'
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; $1 &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; $3 &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
    |
        combi '\n'
        {
            process($1);
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
Note that <code >combi's</code> production rules do not define action blocks. The
standard way to handle these situations is to add <code >$$ = $1</code> action blocks to
non-empty production rules not defining final action blocks. This works well
in the current example, but a <code >default-actions quiet</code> (or <code >warn</code>) option
or directive can also be used.
<p>
The function <code >process</code>, called from <code >combi's</code> action block, inspects the
semantic value's tag to select the proper way of handling the received
semantic value. Here is its implementation:
        <pre>

    void Parser::process(STYPE__ &amp;semVal) const
    {
        if (semVal.tag() == Tag__::INT)
            cout &lt;&lt; "Saw an int-value: " &lt;&lt; semVal.get&lt;Tag__::INT&gt;() &lt;&lt; '\n';
        else
            cout &lt;&lt; "Saw text: " &lt;&lt; semVal.get&lt;Tag__::TEXT&gt;() &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
        
</pre>

<h3 >4.6.2: Actions and shorthand ($) notations</h3>
    Often an action accompanies a production rule. It contains <strong >C++</strong> code that
is executed once that production rule is recognized. The task of most actions
is to compute a semantic value for the nonterminal recognized by the
production rule, often using the semantic values made available by components
of the production rule.
<p>
An action consists of <strong >C++</strong> statements surrounded by braces, much like a
compound statement in <strong >C++</strong>. Most rules have just one action at the end of
the rule, following all the components. Actions in the middle of a rule are
tricky and should be used only for special purposes (see section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#MIDACTIONS">4.6.2.4</a>).
<p>
The components of production rules are numbered, the first component having
number 1. E.g., in a production rule
        <pre>

    nonterm:
        first second third
        
</pre>

    <code >first</code> is component #1, <code >second</code> is component #2, <code >third</code> is
component #3.  <strong >C++</strong> code in action blocks may refer to semantic values of
these components using <em >dollar-notations</em>, where <code >$i</code> refers to
the semantic value of the i^<sup >th</sup> component. 
<p>
Likewise, the semantic value of the rule's nonterminal is represented by
<code >$$</code>. Here is a typical example:
        <pre>

    exp:
        ...
    |
        exp '+' exp
        { 
            $$ = $1 + $3; 
        }
    |
        ...    
        
</pre>

    This rule constructs <code >exp</code> from two exp nonterminals connected by a
plus-sign token. In the action, <code >$1</code> and <code >$3</code> represent the semantic
values of, respectively, the first (left-hand side) <code >exp</code> component, and the
second (right-hand side) <code >exp</code> component.
<p>
The sum is assigned to <code >$$</code>, which becomes the semantic value of the <code >exp</code>
nonterminal represented by the production rule.
<p>
Depending on the specification of the <code >default-actions</code> option/directive
(cf. section <a href="bisonc++04.html#DEFAULTACTION">4.5.4</a>) <strong >bisonc++</strong> may supply non-empty production rules
with default action blocks containing the statement <code >$$ = $1</code>: the semantic
value of the first component of the production rule is returned as the
nonterminal's semantic value. Of course, the default action only is valid if
the two data types match. Empty production rules are not provided with
default action blocks.
<p>
Negative dollar indices (e.g., $-1) are allowed, and refer to semantic
values of elements in rules before the component naming the current rule's
nonterminal. This is a risky practice, and you should use it only when you
know what you're doing. Here is a situation where you can use this reliably:
        <pre>

    vardef:
        type varlist ';'
    ;
    
    varlist:
        varlist ',' variable
        {
            defineVar($-1, $3);
        }
    |
        variable
        {
            defineVar($-1, $1);
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
As long as <code >varlist</code> is only used in the <code >vardef</code> rule <code >varlist</code> can
be sure that the type of the variable is available as the semantic value of
the component immediately before (hence: $-1) the <code >varlist</code> component in the
<code >vardef</code> rule. See also section <a href="bisonc++05.html#SPECIAL">5.6</a>.
<p>
In addition to the dollar-notations shown here, <strong >bisonc++</strong> supports several more
dollar-notations. The next three subsections describe the dollar-notations
that are available after specifying, respectively, the <code >%stype, %union</code> or
<code >%polymorphic</code> directives.
<p>
<a name="l65"></a>
<h4 >4.6.2.1: %stype shorthand notations</h4>
        The <code >%stype</code> directive is used to specify a single semantic value type. By
default the semantic value type is <code >int</code>. For single type semantic values
several dollar-notations are available. If some of the dollar-notations shown
below appear to be redundant: that's because their meanings are identical when
using single type semantic values. Their meanings differ, however, when using
union or polymorphic semantic values. Furthermore, below the notation $1 is
used as a generic reference to semantic values of production rule
components. Instead of $1 other available numbered dollar references can also
be used.
<p>
Here is the overview:
        <ul>
    <li><code >$$ = </code> 
<p>
A value is assigned to the rule's nonterminal's semantic value. The
right-hand side (rhs) of the assignment expression must be an expression of a
type that can be assigned to the <code >STYPE__</code> type.
<p>
<li><code >$$(expr)</code>
<p>
Same as the previous dollar-notation: <code >expr's</code> value is assigned to
the rule's nonterminal's semantic value.
<p>
<li><code >_$$</code>
<p>
This refers to the semantic value of the rule's nonterminal.
<p>
<li><code >$$</code>
<p>
Same as the previous item: this refers to the semantic value of the rule's
nonterminal. 
<p>
<li><code >$$.</code>
<p>
If <code >STYPE__</code> is a class-type then this dollar-notation is shorthand
for the member selector operator, applied to the rule's nonterminal's semantic
value.
<p>
<li><code >$$-&gt;</code>
<p>
If <code >STYPE__</code> is a class-type then this dollar-notation is shorthand
for the pointer to member operator, applied to the rule's nonterminal's
semantic value.
<p>
<li><code >_$1</code>
<p>
This refers to the current production rule's first component's semantic
value.
<p>
<li><code >$1</code>
<p>
Same as the previous dollar-notation: this refers to the 
current production rule's first component's semantic value.
<p>
<li><code >$1.</code>
<p>
If <code >STYPE__</code> is a class-type then this dollar-notation is shorthand
for the member selector operator, applied to the current production rule's
first component's semantic value.
<p>
<li><code >$1-&gt;</code>
<p>
If <code >STYPE__</code> is a class-type then this dollar-notation is shorthand
for the pointer to member operator, applied to the current production rule's
first component's semantic value.
<p>
<li><code >_$-1</code>
<p>
This refers to the semantic value of a component in a production rule,
listed immediately before the current rule's nonterminal ($-2 refers to a
component used two elements before the current nonterminal, etc.).
<p>
<li><code >$-1</code>
<p>
Same as the previous item: this refers to the semantic value of a
component in a production rule, listed immediately before the current rule's
nonterminal.
<p>
<li><code >$-1.</code>
<p>
If <code >STYPE__</code> is a class-type then this dollar-notation is shorthand
for the member selector operator, applied to the semantic value
of some production rule element, 1 element before the current rule's
nonterminal.
<p>
<li><code >$-1-&gt;</code>
<p>
If <code >STYPE__</code> is a class-type then this dollar-notation is shorthand
for the pointer to member operator, applied to the semantic value
of some production rule element, 1 element before the current rule's
nonterminal.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l66"></a>
<h4 >4.6.2.2: %union shorthand notations</h4>
        The <code >%union</code> directive is used to specify a union of semantic value types.
Although each semantic value type can be used for each <code >STYPE__</code> variable,
(non)terminals are in practice associated with a single type. These
associations are automatically applied through <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s  dollar-notations.
<p>
Note that the <code >%union</code> directive is now largely superseded by the facilities
offered by the <code >%polymorphic</code> directive. Using <code >%union</code> is considered
somewhat `old school', as <code >%polymorphic</code> implements cleaner type
definitions, allowing <strong >bisonc++</strong> and the <strong >C++</strong> compiler to verify that types are
correctly being used.
<p>
In the next overview the notation $1 is used as a generic reference to
semantic values of production rule components. Instead of $1 other available
numbered dollar references can also be used.
<p>
<a name="l67"></a>
<h4 >4.6.2.3: %polymorphic shorthand notations</h4>
        The <code >%polymorphic</code> directive is used to specify a series of semantic value
types. (Non)terminals can be associated with exactly one of these types, or
with the generic <code >STYPE__</code> semantic value type. When the latter type is used
either another <code >STYPE__</code> value can be assigned to it, or a value of one of
the defined polymorphic value types can be assigned to it.  At any time an
<code >STYPE__</code> can only hold one single value type. Polymorphic semantic types
are type safe: types cannot be confused. Furthermore, as <code >STYPE__</code> objects
are responsible for their own memory management, memory leaks cannot occur,
assuming that the different semantic value types do not leak.
<p>
In the next overview the available dollar-notations that are available with
polymorphic semantic values are described. In this overview $1 is used as a
generic reference to semantic values of production rule components. Instead of
$1 other available numbered dollar references can also be used.
<p>
<ul>
    <li><code >$$ = </code> 
<p>
A semantic value is assigned to the rule's nonterminal's semantic
value. The right-hand side (rhs) of the assignment expression must be an
expression of the type that is associated with $$. This assignment operation
assumes that the type of the rhs-expression equals $$'s semantic value
type. If the types don't match the compiler issues a compilation error when
compiling <code >parse.cc</code>. Casting the rhs to the correct value type is possible,
but in that case the function call operator (see the next item) is preferred,
as it does not require casting. If no semantic value type was associated with
$$ then the assignment <code >$$ = STYPE__{}</code> can be used.
<p>
<li><code >$$(expr)</code>
<p>
A value is assigned to the rule's nonterminal's semantic value. <code >Expr</code>
must be of a type that can be statically cast to $$'s semantic value type. The
required <code >static_cast</code> is generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong> and doesn't have to be
specified for <code >expr</code>.
<p>
<li><code >_$$</code>
<p>
This refers to the rule's nonterminal's semantic value, disregarding any
polymorphic type that might have been associated with the rule's nonterminal.
<p>
<li><code >$$</code>
<p>
If no polymorphic type was associated with the rule's nonterminal then
this is shorthand for a reference to the rule's plain <code >STYPE__</code> value. If a
polymorphic value type was associated with the rule's nonterminal then this
shorthand represents a reference to a value of that particular type.
<p>
<li><code >$$.</code>
<p>
If no polymorphic type was associated with the rule's nonterminal then
this is shorthand for the member selector operator, applied to a reference to
the rule's nonterminal's <code >STYPE__</code> value.  If a polymorphic value type was
associated with the rule's nonterminal then this shorthand represents the
member selector operator, applied to a reference of that particular type.
<p>
<li><code >$$-&gt;</code>
<p>
If no polymorphic type was associated with the rule's nonterminal then
this is shorthand for the pointer to member operator, applied to a reference
to the rule's nonterminal's <code >STYPE__</code> value.  If a polymorphic value type
was associated with the rule's nonterminal then this shorthand represents the
pointer to member operator, applied to a reference of that particular type.
<p>
<li><code >_$1</code>
<p>
This refers to the current production rule's first component's generic
<code >STYPE__</code> value.
<p>
<li><code >$1</code>
<p>
This shorthand refers to the semantic value of the production rule's
first element. If it was associated with a polymorphic type, then <code >$1</code>
refers to a value of that particular type. If no association was defined then
<code >$1</code> represents a generic <code >STYPE__</code> value.
<p>
<li><code >$1.</code>
<p>
If the production rule's first component's semantic value was associated
with a polymorphic type, then <code >$1.</code> is shorthand for the member selector
operator, applied to the value of the associated polymorphic type. If no
association was defined then <code >$1.</code> is shorthand for the member selector
operator, applied to the first component's generic <code >STYPE__</code> value.
<p>
<li><code >$1-&gt;</code>
<p>
If the production rule's first component's semantic value was associated
with a polymorphic type, then <code >$1-&gt;</code> is shorthand for the pointer to member 
operator, applied to the value of the associated polymorphic type. If no
association was defined then <code >$1.</code> is shorthand for the pointer to member 
operator, applied to the first component's generic <code >STYPE__</code> value.
<p>
<li><code >_$-1</code>
<p>
This refers to the generic (<code >STYPE__</code>) value of a component in a
production rule, listed immediately before the current rule's nonterminal ($-2
refers to a component used two elements before the current nonterminal, etc.).
<p>
<li><code >$-1</code>
<p>
Same: this refers to the generic (<code >STYPE__</code>) value of a component in a
production rule, listed immediately before the current rule's nonterminal ($-2
refers to a component used two elements before the current nonterminal, etc.).
<p>
<li><code >$-1.</code>
<p>
This is shorthand for the member selector operator applied to to the
generic <code >STYPE__</code> value of some production rule element, 1 element before
the current rule's nonterminal.
<p>
<li><code >$-1-&gt;</code>
<p>
This is shorthand for the pointer to member operator applied to to the
generic <code >STYPE__</code> value of some production rule element, 1 element before
the current rule's nonterminal.
<p>
<li><code >$&lt;tag&gt;-1</code>
<p>
This shorthand represents a reference to the semantic value of the
polymorphic type associated with <code >tag</code> of some production rule element, 1
element before the current rule's nonterminal.
<p>
If, when using the generated parser's class <code >parse</code> function, the
polymorphic type of that element turns out not to match the type that is
associated with <code >tag</code> then a run-time fatal error results. 
<p>
If that happens, and the <code >debug</code> option/directive had been specified when
<strong >bisonc++</strong> was run, then rerun the program after specifying
<code >parser.setDebug(Parser::ACTIONCASES)</code> to locate the <code >parse</code> function's
action block where the fatal error was encountered.
<p>
<li><code >$&lt;tag&gt;-1.</code>
<p>
This shorthand represents the member selector operator, applied to the
semantic value of the polymorphic type associated with <code >tag</code> of some
production rule element, 1 element before the current rule's nonterminal.
<p>
If, when using the generated parser's class <code >parse</code> function, the
polymorphic type of that element turns out not to match the type that is
associated with <code >tag</code> then a run-time fatal error results.  The procedure
suggested at the previous (<code >$&lt;tag&gt;-1</code>) item for solving such errors can be
applied here as well.
<p>
<li><code >$&lt;tag&gt;-1-&gt;</code>
<p>
This shorthand represents the pointer to member selector operator, applied
to the semantic value of the polymorphic type associated with <code >tag</code> of some
production rule element, 1 element before the current rule's nonterminal.
<p>
If, when using the generated parser's class <code >parse</code> function, the
polymorphic type of that element turns out not to match the type that is
associated with <code >tag</code> then a run-time fatal error results.  The procedure
suggested at the previous (<code >$&lt;tag&gt;-1</code>) item for solving such errors can be
applied here as well.

<h4 >4.6.2.4: Mid-Rule Action Blocks</h4>
        Occasionally it is useful to insert an action block somewhere in the middle of
a production rule. These so-called mid-rule action blocks are comparable to
the usual action blocks, appearing at the end of production rules, but
mid-rule action blocks are executed before the parser has recognized the
production rule's components that follow them.
<p>
A mid-rule action block can refer to the components preceding it using <code >$i</code>,
but it may not (cannot) refer to subsequent components because it is executed
before they have been observed.
<p>
The mid-rule action block itself counts as one of the components of the
production rule. In the example shown below, <code >stmnt</code> can be referred to as
<code >$6</code> in the final action block.
<p>
Mid-rule action blocks can also have semantic values. When using <code >%union</code> or
<code >%polymorphic</code> and a rule's nonterminal is associated with a union field or
polymorphic token, then mid-rule action blocks loose those associations. When
the <code >$$, $$.</code> or <code >$$-&gt;</code> shorthand notations appear in mid-action blocks of
production rules whose nonterminal is associated with a polymorphic type or
union field then a warning is issued that automatic type associations do not
apply. Using the <code >_$$</code> shorthand notation prevents the warning from being
issued. 
<p>
Here is an example from a hypothetical grammar, defining a <code >let</code> statement
that looks like `this:
        <pre>

    let (variable) statement
        
</pre>

    Here, <code >variable</code> is the name of a variable that must only exists for the
<code >statement's</code> lifetime. To parse this construct, we must insert <code >variable</code>
into a symbol table before parsing <code >statement</code>, and must remove it
afterward. Here is how it is done:
        <pre>

    stmt:   
        LET '(' variable ')'
        {
            _$$.assign&lt;SYMTAB&gt;(symtab());
            addVariable($3); 
        }
        stmt    
        { 
            $$ = $6;
            restoreSymtab($5); 
        }
        
</pre>

    As soon as `<code >let (variable)</code>' has been recognized, the first action is
executed. It saves the current symbol table as the mid-rule's semantic value,
using the polymorphic tag <code >SYMTAB</code> (which could be associated with, e.g., an
<code >std::unordered_map</code>).  Then <code >addVariable</code> receives the new variable's
name, adding it to the current symbol table. Once the first action is
finished, the embedded statement (<code >stmt</code>) is parsed. Note that the mid-rule
action is component number 5, so `<code >stmt</code>' is component number 6.
<p>
Once <code >statement</code> has been parsed, its semantic value is returned as the
semantic value of the production rule's nonterminal. Then the semantic value
from the mid-rule action block is used to restore the symbol table to its
original state. This removes the temporary <code >let</code>-variable from the list so
that it won't appear to exist while the rest of the program is parsed.
<p>
Defining mid-rule action blocks before a rule has completely been recognized
often leads to conflicts since the parser, because of the single look-ahead
tokoen, must make a decision about the parsing sequence to use.  For example,
the following two rules, without mid-rule actions, can coexist because the
parser can always process the open-brace token and only then look at the next
token before deciding whether there is a declaration or not:
        <pre>

    compound: 
        '{' declarations statements '}'
    | 
        '{' statements '}'
    ;
        
</pre>

    But when we an action block is inserted before the first open-parenthesis
a conflict is introduced:
        <pre>

    compound: 
        { 
            prepareForLocalVariables(); 
        }
        '{' declarations statements '}'
    | 
        '{' statements '}'
    ;
        
</pre>

    Now the parser, encountering the open-parenthesis, must decide whether the
open-parenthesis belongs to the first or second production rule. It must make
this decision because it must execute the statement in the action block if it
selects the first production rule, while no action is required when selecting
the second production rule (cf. section <a href="bisonc++07.html#LOOKAHEAD">7.0.3</a>).
<p>
This problem cannot be solved by putting identical actions into the two rules,
like so:
        <pre>

        { 
            prepareForLocalVariables(); 
        }
        '{' declarations statements '}'
    | 
        { 
            prepareForLocalVariables(); 
        }
        '{' statements '}'
    ;
        
</pre>

    But this does not solve the issue, because <strong >bisonc++</strong> considers all action blocks
as unique elements of production rules, and does not inspect the action
blocks' contents.
<p>
A solution to the above problem consists of hiding the action block in a
support nonterminal symbol which recognizes the first block-open brace and
then performs the required preparations:
        <pre>

    openblock:
        '{'
        { 
            prepareForLocalVariables(); 
        }
    ;

    compound: 
            openblock declarations statements '}'
    | 
            openblock statements '}'
    ;
        
</pre>

    Now <strong >bisonc++</strong> can execute the action in the rule for subroutine without
deciding which rule for compound it eventually uses. Note that the action
is now at the end of its rule. Any mid-rule action can be converted to an
end-of-rule action in this way, and this is what <strong >bisonc++</strong> actually does to
implement mid-rule actions. <strong >Bisonc++</strong> converts mid-rule action blocks to hash-tag
numbered elements in production rules. In a rule like
        <pre>

    string:
        {
            ...
        }
        TOKEN
        ...
    ;
        
</pre>

    warning messages referring to the mid-rule action block could look like
this: 
        <pre>

    [grammar: warning] Line 10: `rule 3: string -&gt;  #0001': ...
        
</pre>

    Here, `#0001' is the hidden nonterminal merely containing the mid-rule
action block. It is as though we had written this grammar:
        <pre>

    string:
        #0001 TOKEN
        ...
    ;

    #0001:
        {
            ...
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<h2 >4.7: Basic Grammatical Constructions</h2>
In the following sections several basic building blocks for writing grammars
are presented in their prototypical forms. When these building blocks are
used to write a grammar, the resulting grammar is usually accepted by
<strong >bisonc++</strong>. Moreover, these building blocks are frequently encountered in
programming languages. When designing your own grammar, try to stick as
closely as possible to the following basic forms.
<p>
<a name="l70"></a>
<h3 >4.7.1: Plain Alternatives</h3>
    Simple alternatives can be specified using the vertical bar (<code >|</code>). Each
alternative should begin with a unique identifying terminal token. The
terminal token may actually be hidden in a nonterminal rule, in which case
that nonterminal can be used as an alias for the nonterminal. In fact
identical terminal tokens may be used if at some point the terminal tokens
differ over different alternatives. Here are some examples:
        <pre>

    // Example 1:  plain terminal distinguishing tokens
    expr:
        ID        
    |
        NUMBER
    ;

    // Example 2:  nested terminal distinguishing tokens
    expr:
        id
    |
        number
    ;

    id:
        ID
    ;

    number:
        NUMBER
    ;

    // Example 3:  eventually diverting routes
    expr:
        ID
        id
    |
        ID
        number
    ;

    id:
        ID
    ;

    number:
        NUMBER
    ;
        
</pre>

<h3 >4.7.2: One Or More Alternatives, No Separators</h3>
    A series of elements normally use left-recursion. For example, <strong >C++</strong>
supports <em >string concatenation</em>: series of double quote delimited <code >ASCII</code>
characters define a string, and multiple white-space delimited strings are
handled as one single string:
        <pre>

    "hello"         // multiple ws-delimited strings
    " " 
    "world"

    "hello world"   // same thing
        
</pre>

    Usually a parser is responsible for concatenating the individual
string-parts, receiving one or more <code >STRING</code> tokens from the lexical
scanner. A <code >string</code> rule handles one or more incoming <code >STRING</code> tokens:
        <pre>

    string:
        STRING
    |
        string STRING
        
</pre>

    The above rule can be used as a prototype for recognizing a series of
elements. The token <code >STRING</code> may of course be embedded in another rule. The
generic form of this rule could be formulated as follows:
        <pre>

    series:
        unit
    |
        series unit
        
</pre>

    Note that the single element is <em >first</em> recognized, whereafter the
left-recursive alternative may be recognized repeatedly.
<p>
<a name="OPTSERIES"></a><a name="l72"></a>
<h3 >4.7.3: Zero Or More Alternatives, No Separators</h3>
    An <em >optional</em> series of elements also use left-recursion, but the single
element alternative remains empty. For example, in <strong >C++</strong> a compound
statement may contain statements or declarations, but it may also be empty:
        <pre>

    opt_statements:
        // empty
    |
        opt_statements statements
        
</pre>

    The above rule can be used as a prototype for recognizing a series of
elements: the generic form of this rule could be formulated as follows:
        <pre>

    opt_series:
        // empty
    |
        opt_series unit
        
</pre>

    Note that the empty element is recognized <em >first</em>, even though it is
empty, whereafter the left-recursive alternative may be recognized repeatedly.
In practice this means that an <em >action block</em> may be defined at the empty
alternative, which is then executed prior to the left-recursive
alternative. Such an action block could be used to perform initializations
necessary for the proper handling of the left-recursive alternative.
<p>
<a name="l73"></a>
<h3 >4.7.4: One Or More Alternatives, Using Separators</h3>
    A series of elements which are separated from each other using some delimiter
again normally uses left-recursion. For example, a <strong >C++</strong> variable definition
list consists of one or more identifiers, separated by comma's. If there is
only one identifier no comma is used. Here is the rule defining a list using
separators: 
        <pre>

    variables:
        IDENTIFIER
    |
        variables ',' IDENTIFIER
        
</pre>

    The above rule can be used as a prototype for recognizing a series of
delimited elements. The generic form of this rule could be formulated as
follows:
        <pre>

    series:
        unit
    |
        series delimiter unit
        
</pre>

    Note that the single element is <em >first</em> recognized, whereafter the
left-recursive alternative may be recognized repeatedly. In fact, this rule is
not really different from the standard rule for a series, which does not hold
true for the rule to recognize an <em >optional</em> series of delimited elements,
covered in the next section.
<p>

<h3 >4.7.5: Zero Or More Alternatives, Using Separators</h3>
    An optional series of elements, separated from each other using delimiters
occurs frequently in programming languages. For example, <strong >C++</strong> functions
have parameter lists which may or may not require arguments. Since a parameter
list may be defined empty, an <em >empty</em> alternative is required. However, a
simple generalization of the optional series construction (section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#OPTSERIES">4.7.3</a>) won't work, since that would imply that the <em >first</em> argument
is preceded by a separator, which is clearly not the intention. So, the
following construction is <em >wrong</em>:
        <pre>

    opt_parlist:
        // empty
    |
        opt_parlist ',' parameter
        
</pre>

    To define an optional series of delimited elements <em >two</em> rules are
required: one rule handling the optional part, the other the delimited series
of elements. So, the correct definition is as follows:
        <pre>

    opt_parlist:
        // empty
    |
        parlist
    ;

    parlist:
        parameter
    |
        parlist ',' parameter
    ;
        
</pre>

    Again, the above rule pair can be used as a prototype for recognizing an
optional series of delimited elements. The generic form of these rules could
be formulated as follows:
        <pre>

    opt_series:
        // empty
    |
        series
    ;

    series:
        element
    |
        series delimiter element
        
</pre>

    Note that the <code >opt_series</code> rules neatly distinguishes the no-element
case from the case were elements are present. Usually these two cases need to
be handled quite differently, and the <code >opt_series</code> rules empty alternative
easily allows us to recognize the no-elements case.
<p>
<a name="l75"></a>
<h3 >4.7.6: Nested Blocks</h3>
    Finally, we add the <em >nested</em> rule to our bag of rule-tricks. Again, nested
rules appear frequently: parenthesized expressions and compound statements are
two very well known examples. These kind of rules are characterized by the
fact that the nested variant is itself an example of the element appearing in
the nested variant. The definition of a statement is actually a bit more
complex than the definition of an expression, since the statement appearing in
the compound statement is in fact an optional series of elements. Let's first
have a look at the nested expression rule. Here it is, in a basic form:
        <pre>

    expr:
        NUMBER
    |
        ID
    |
        expr '+' expr
    |
        ...
    |
        '(' expr ')'
    ;
        
</pre>

    This definition is simply characterized that the nonterminal <code >expr</code>
appears within a set of parentheses, which is not too complex. 
<p>
The definition of <code >opt_statements</code>, however, is a bit more complex. But
acknowledging the fact that a <code >statement</code> contains among other elements a
compound statement, and that a compound statement, in turn, contains
<code >opt_statements</code> an <code >opt_statements</code> construction can be formulated
accordingly:
        <pre>

    opt_statements:         // define an optional series
        // empty
    |
        opt_statements statement
    ;
        
    statement:              // define alternatives for `statement'
        expr_statement
    |
        if_statement
    |
        ...
    |
        compound_statement
    ;

    compound_statement:     // define the compound statement itself
        '{' opt_statements '}'
    ;
        
</pre>

<h2 >4.8: Multiple Parsers in the Same Program</h2>
Most programs that use <strong >bisonc++</strong> parse only one language and therefore contain
only one <strong >bisonc++</strong> parser. But what if you want to parse more than one language
with the same program? Since <strong >bisonc++</strong> constructs <em >class</em> rather than a
<em >parsing function</em>, this problem can easily be solved: simply define your
second (third, fourth, ...) parser class, each having its own unique
class-name, using the <code >%class-name</code> directive, and construct parser objects
of each of the defined classes.
