<h2 >9.1: Bisonc++ options</h2>
    Where available, single letter options are listed between parentheses
beyond their associated long-option variants. Single letter options require
arguments if their associated long options also require arguments. Options
affecting the class- or implementation header files are ignored if these
files already exist. Options accepting a `filename' do not accept path names,
i.e., they cannot contain directory separators (<code >/</code>); options accepting a
'pathname' may contain directory separators.
<p>
Some options may cause errors. This happens when they conflict with the
contents of a file which <strong >bisonc++</strong> cannot modify (e.g., a parser class header file
exists, but doesn't define a namespace, but a <code >--namespace</code> option was
specified).
<p>
To solve the error the offending option could be omitted; the existing file
could be removed; or the existing file could be hand-edited according to the
option's specification. 
<p>
Note that <strong >bisonc++</strong> currently does not handle the opposite error condition: if a
previously used option is omitted, then <strong >bisonc++</strong> does not report an
inconsistency. In those cases compilation errors may be observed.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong >--analyze-only</strong> (<strong >-A</strong>)<br/>
           Only analyze the grammar. No files are (re)written. This option can
            be used to test the grammatic correctness of modification `in
            situ', without overwriting previously generated files. If the
            grammar contains syntactic errors only syntax analysis is 
            performed.
<p>
<li> <strong >--baseclass-header</strong>=<code >filename</code> (<strong >-b</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Filename</code> defines the name of the file to contain the parser's
            base class. This class defines, e.g., the parser's symbolic
            tokens. Defaults to the name of the parser class plus the suffix
            <code >base.h</code>. It is generated, unless otherwise indicated (see
            <code >--no-baseclass-header</code> and <code >--dont-rewrite-baseclass-header</code>
            below).
<p>
It is an error if this option is used and an already
            existing parser class header file does not contain <code >#include
            "filename"</code>.
<p>
<li> <a name="PREINCLUDE"></a> <strong >--baseclass-preinclude</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-H</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines  the path to the file preincluded in the
            parser's base-class header. This option is needed in situations
            where the base class header file refers to types which might not
            yet be known. E.g., with polymorphic semantic values a
            <code >std::string</code> value type might be used. Since the <code >string</code>
            header file is not by default included in <code >parserbase.h</code> we
            somehow need to inform the compiler about this and possibly other
            headers. The suggested procedure is to use a pre-include header
            file declaring the required types. By default `<code >header</code>' is
            surrounded by double quotes: <code >#include "header"</code> is used when
            the option <code >-H header</code> is specified.  When the argument is
            surrounded by pointed brackets <code >#include &lt;header&gt;</code> is
            included. In the latter case, quotes might be required to escape
            interpretation by the shell (e.g., using <code >-H '&lt;header&gt;'</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--baseclass-skeleton</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-B</strong>)<br/> 
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name to the file containing the
            skeleton of the parser's base class. It defaults to the
            installation-defined default path name (e.g.,
            <code >/usr/share/bisonc++/</code> plus <code >bisonc++base.h</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--class-header</strong>=<code >filename</code> (<strong >-c</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Filename</code> defines the name of the file to contain the parser
            class. Defaults to the name of the parser class plus the suffix
            <code >.h</code>
<p>
It is an error if this option is used and an already
            existing implementation header file does not contain <code >#include
            "filename"</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--class-name</strong> <code >className</code> <br/>
           Defines the name of the <strong >C++</strong> class that is generated.  If
            neither this option, nor the <code >%class-name</code> directory is
            specified, then the default class name (<code >Parser</code>) is used.
<p>
It is an error if this option is used and <code >className</code> differs
            from the name of the class that is defined in an already existing
            parser-class header file and/or if an already existing
            implementation header file does not define members of the class
            <code >`className'</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--class-skeleton</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-C</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name to the file containing the
            skeleton of the parser class. It defaults to the
            installation-defined default path name (e.g.,
            <code >/usr/share/bisonc++/</code> plus <code >bisonc++.h</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--construction</strong><br/> 
           Details about the construction of the parsing tables are written to
            the same file as written by the <code >--verbose</code> option (i.e.,
            <code >&lt;grammar&gt;.output</code>, where <code >&lt;grammar&gt;</code> is the input file read
            by <strong >bisonc++</strong>). This information is primarily useful for developers. It
            augments the information written to the verbose grammar output
            file, generated by the <code >--verbose</code> option.
<p>
<li> <strong >--debug</strong><br/> 
           Provide the generated <code >parse</code> and its support functions with
            debugging code, optionally showing the actual parsing process on
            the standard output stream. When included, the debugging output is
            active by default, but its activity may be controlled using the
            <code >setDebug(bool on-off)</code> member. <strong >Bisonc++</strong> does not use <code >#ifdef
            DEBUG</code> macros. Rerun <strong >bisonc++</strong> without the <code >--debug</code> option to
            remove the debugging code.
<p>
Note that this option does <em >not</em> show the actions of <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s own
            parser, its own lexical scanner or merely the numbers of the
            case-entries executed by the parser's <code >parse</code> function. If that
            is what you want, use the <code >--own-debug, --action-cases,
            --scanner-debug</code> and/or <code >--own-tokens</code> options.
<p>
When polymorphic semantic values
            are used (see section
<a href="bisonc++04.html#POLYMORPHIC">4.6.1</a>)
           then the generated parser might attempt to retrieve an incorrect
            polymorphic value. In that case a fatal error is generated, ending
            <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s run. The error message itself cannot refer to the action
            block where the error occurred. If this situation is encountered,
            rerun <strong >bisonc++</strong>, specifying <code >--debug</code> and call
            <code >parser.setDebug(Parser::ACTIONCASES)</code>: as a debugging aid the
            generated parser then shows the executeAction switch's case entry
            numbers just before their execution.
<p>
<li> <strong >--default-actions</strong>=<code >off|quiet|warn</code> (<strong >-d</strong>)<br/>
           When <code >warn</code> is specified (which is the default) an action block
            executing <code >$$ = $1</code> (or <code >$$ = STYPE__{}</code> for empty production
            rules) is added to production rules that do not explicitly define
            their own final action blocks, while issuing a warning. When
            <code >quiet</code> is specified these action blocks are silently added. It
            is an error when the types of $$ and $1 differ (but it is OK if
            neither $$ nor $1 is associated with a specific type). When
            <code >off</code> is specified no action blocks are added (issuing a warning
            issued, unless the option/directive <code >tag-mismatches off</code> has
            been specified).
<p>
<li> <a name="ERRORVERBOSE"></a><strong >--error-verbose</strong><br/>
           When a syntactic error is reported, the generated parse function
            dumps the parser's state stack to the standard output
            stream. The stack dump shows on separate lines a stack index
            followed by the state stored at the indicated stack element. The
            first stack element is the stack's top element.
<p>
<li> <strong >--filenames</strong>=<code >filename</code> (<strong >-f</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Filename</code> is a generic file name that is used for all header
            files generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong>. Options defining specific file names are
            also available (which then, in turn, overrule the name specified
            by this option).
<p>
<li> <strong >--flex</strong><br/> 
           <strong >Bisonc++</strong> generates code calling <code >d_scanner.yylex()</code> to obtain the
            next lexical token, and calling <code >d_scanner.YYText()</code> for the
            matched text, unless overruled by options or directives explicitly
            defining these functions. By default, the interface defined by
            <strong >flexc++</strong>(1) is used. This option is only interpreted if the
            <code >--scanner</code> option or <code >%scanner</code> directive is also used.
<p>
<li> <strong >--help</strong> (<strong >-h</strong>)<br/>
            Write basic usage information to the standard output stream and
            terminate. 
<p>
<li> <strong >--implementation-header</strong>=<code >filename</code> (<strong >-i</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Filename</code> defines the name of the file to contain the
            implementation header. It defaults to the name of the generated
            parser class plus the suffix <code >.ih</code>.
<p>
The implementation header should contain all directives and
            declarations <em >only</em> used by the implementations of the parser's
            member functions. It is the only header file that is included by
            the source file containing <code >parse</code>'s implementation. User
            defined implementation of other class members may use the same
            convention, thus concentrating all directives and declarations
            that are required for the compilation of other source files
            belonging to the parser class in one header file.
<p>
<li> <strong >--implementation-skeleton</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-I</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name to the file containing the
            skeleton of the implementation header. t defaults to the
            installation-defined default path name (e.g.,
            <code >/usr/share/bisonc++/</code> plus <code >bisonc++.ih</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--insert-stype</strong><br/>
           This option is only effective if the <code >debug</code> option (or
            <code >%debug</code> directive) has been specified. When <code >insert-stype</code>
            has been specified the parsing function's debug output also shows
            selected semantic values. It should only be used if objects or
            variables of the semantic value type <code >STYPE__</code> can be inserted
            into <code >ostreams</code>.
<p>
<li> <a name="MAXDEPTH"></a> <strong >--max-inclusion-depth</strong>=<code >value</code><br/>
           Set the maximum number of nested grammar files. Defaults to 10.
<p>
<li> <strong >--namespace</strong> <code >identifier</code> <br/>
           Define all of the code generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong> in the namespace
            <code >identifier</code>. By default no namespace is defined. If this
            options is used the implementation header is provided with a
            commented out <code >using namespace</code> declaration for the specified
            namespace. In addition, the parser and parser base class
            header files also use the specified namespace to define their
            include guard directives.
<p>
It is an error if this option is used and an already existing
            parser-class header file and/or implementation header file does
            not define <code >namespace identifier</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--no-baseclass-header</strong><br/>
           Do not write the file containing the parser class' base class, even
            if that file doesn't yet exist. By default the file containing the
            parser's base class is (re)written each time <strong >bisonc++</strong> is called. Note
            that this option should normally be avoided, as the base class
            defines the symbolic terminal tokens that are returned by the
            lexical scanner. When the construction of this file is suppressed,
            modifications of these terminal tokens are not communicated to the
            lexical scanner.
<p>
<li> <strong >--no-decoration</strong> (<strong >-D</strong>)<br/>
           Do not include user-defined or default actions when generating the
            parser's <code >parse</code> member. This effectively generates a parser
            which merely performs syntax checks, without performing the
            actions which are normally executed when rules have been
            matched. This may be useful in situations where a (partially or
            completely) decorated grammar is reorganized, and the syntactic
            correctness of the modified grammar must be verified, or in
            situations where the grammar has already been decorated, but
            functions which are called from the rules's actions have not yet
            been impleemented.
<p>
<li> <strong >--no-lines</strong><br/> 
           Do not put <code >#line</code> preprocessor directives in the file containing
            the parser's <code >parse</code> function. By default the file containing
            the parser's <code >parse</code> function also contains <code >#line</code>
            preprocessor directives. This option allows the compiler and
            debuggers to associate errors with lines in your grammar
            specification file, rather than with the source file containing
            the <code >parse</code> function itself.
<p>
<li> <strong >--no-parse-member</strong><br/>
           Do not write the file containing the parser's predefined parser
            member functions, even if that file doesn't yet exist. By default
            the file containing the parser's <code >parse</code> member function is
            (re)written each time <strong >bisonc++</strong> is called. Note that this option
            should normally be avoided, as this file contains parsing
            tables which are altered whenever the grammar definition is
            modified. 
<p>
<li> <strong >--own-debug</strong><br/>
           Displays the actions performed by <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s parser when it processes
            the grammar specification <strong >s</strong> (lots of output!). This implies
            the <code >--verbose</code> option.
<p>
<li> <strong >--own-tokens</strong> (<strong >-T</strong>)<br/>
           The tokens returned as well as the text matched by <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s lexcial
            scanner are shown when this option is used.
<p>
This option does <em >not</em> result in the <em >generated</em> parsing
            function displaying returned tokens and matched text. If that is
            what you want, use the <code >--print-tokens</code> option.
<p>
<li> <strong >--parsefun-skeleton</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-P</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name of the file containing the
            parsing member function's skeleton. It defaults to the
            installation-defined default path name (e.g.,
            <code >/usr/share/bisonc++/</code> plus <code >bisonc++.cc</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--parsefun-source</strong>=<code >filename</code> (<strong >-p</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Filename</code> defines the name of the source file to contain the
            parser member function <code >parse</code>. Defaults to <code >parse.cc</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--polymorphic-code-skeleton</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-L</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name of the file containing the
            non-template members of the polymorphic Base class.  It defaults
            to the installation-defined default path name (e.g.,
            <code >/usr/share/bisonc++/</code> plus <code >bisonc++polymorphic</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--polymorphic-skeleton</strong>=<code >pathame</code> (<strong >-M</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name of the file containing the
            skeleton of the polymorphic template classes. It defaults to the
            installation-defined default path name (e.g.,
            <code >/usr/share/bisonc++/</code> plus <code >bisonc++polymorphic.code</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--print-tokens</strong> (<strong >-t</strong>)<br/>
           The generated parsing function implements a function <code >print__</code>
            displaying (on the standard output stream) the tokens returned by
            the parser's scanner as well as the corresponding matched
            text. This implementation is suppressed when the parsing function
            is generated without using this option. The member <code >print__</code> is
            called from <code >Parser::print</code>, which is defined in-line in the the
            parser's class header. Calling <code >Parser::print__</code> can thus easily
            be controlled from <code >print</code>, using, e.g., a variable that set by
            the program using the parser generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong>.
<p>
This option does <em >not</em> show the tokens returned and text matched
            by <strong >bisonc++</strong> itself when it is reading its input <strong >s</strong>. If
            that is what you want, use the <code >--own-tokens</code> option.
<p>
<li> <a name="REQUIRED"></a> <strong >--required-tokens</strong>=<code >number</code><br/>
           Following a syntactic error, require at least <code >number</code>
            successfully processed tokens before another syntactic error can
            be reported. By default <code >number</code> is zero.
<p>
<li> <a name="SCANOPT"></a> <strong >--scanner</strong>=<code >pathname</code> (<strong >-s</strong>)<br/>
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the path name to the file defining the
            scanner's class interface (e.g., <code >"../scanner/scanner.h"</code>). When
            this option is used the parser's member <code >int lex()</code> is
            predefined as
           <pre>

    int Parser::lex()
    {
        return d_scanner.lex();
    }
                
</pre>

           and an object <code >Scanner d_scanner</code> is composed into the parser
            (but see also option <code >scanner-class-name</code>). The example shows
            the function that's called by default. When the <code >--flex</code> option
            (or <code >%flex</code> directive) is specified the function
            <code >d_scanner.yylex()</code> is called. Any other function to call can be
            specified using the <code >--scanner-token-function</code> option (or
            <code >%scanner-token-function</code> directive).
<p>
By default <strong >bisonc++</strong> surrounds <code >pathname</code> by double quotes (using,
            e.g., <code >#include "pathname"</code>).  When <code >pathname</code> is surrounded
            by pointed brackets <code >#include &lt;pathname&gt;</code> is included.
<p>
It is an error if this option is used and an already existing
            parser class header file does not include <code >`pathname'</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--scanner-class-name</strong> <code >scannerClassName</code> <br/> 
           Defines the name of the scanner class, declared by the <code >pathname</code>
            header file that is specified at the <code >scanner</code> option or 
            directive. By default the class name <code >Scanner</code> is used.
<p>
It is an error if this option is used and either the
            <code >scanner</code> option was not provided, or the parser class interface
            in an already existing parser class header file does not declare a
            scanner class <code >d_scanner</code> object.
<p>
<li> <strong >--scanner-debug</strong><br/> 
           Show de scanner's matched rules and returned tokens. This
            extensively displays the rules and tokens matched and returned by
            <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s scanner, instead of just showing the tokens and matched
            text which are received by <strong >bisonc++</strong>. If you want the latter, use the
            option <code >--own-tokens</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--scanner-matched-text-function</strong>=<code >function-call</code><br/> 
           The scanner function returning the text that was matched at the
            last call of the scanner's token function. A complete function
            call expression should be provided (including a scanner object, if
            used). This option overrules the <code >d_scanner.matched()</code> call used
            by default when the <code >%scanner</code> directive is specified, and it
            overrules the <code >d_scanner.YYText()</code> call used when the <code >%flex</code>
            directive is provided. Example:
           <pre>

    --scanner-matched-text-function "myScanner.matchedText()"
                
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >--scanner-token-function</strong>=<code >function-call</code><br/> 
           The scanner function returning the next token, called from the
            parser's <code >lex</code> function. A complete function
            call expression should be provided (including a scanner object, if
            used). This option overrules the <code >d_scanner.lex()</code> call used
            by default when the <code >%scanner</code> directive is specified, and it
            overrules the <code >d_scanner.yylex()</code> call used when the <code >%flex</code>
            directive is provided. Example:
           <pre>

    --scanner-token-function "myScanner.nextToken()"
                
</pre>

<p>
It is an error if this option is used and the scanner token
            function is not called from the code in an already
            existing implementation header.
<p>
<li> <strong >--show-filenames</strong><br/> 
           Writes the names of the generated files to the standard error
            stream.
<p>
<li> <strong >--skeleton-directory</strong>=<code >directory</code> (<strong >-S</strong>)<br/> 
           Specifies the directory containing the skeleton files. In addition
            to specifying a common names for the skeleton files the locations
            of individual skeleton files can be specified using the options
            (<code >-B -C, -H, -I, -L</code> and <code >-M</code>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--stack-expansion</strong>(size)<br/> 
           Defines the number of elements to be added to the generated
            parser's semantic value stack when it must be enlarged. By default
            10 elements are added to the stack. This option/directive is
            interpreted only once, and only if <code >size</code> at least equals the
            default stack expansion size of 10.
<p>
<li> <strong >--tag-mismatches</strong> <code >off|on</code><br/>
           When <code >on</code> is specified (which is the default), a warning is
            issued if no $$ assignment was detected in an action block, or if
            adding a default $$ = ... action was suppressed (cf.  the
            <code >default-actions off</code> option or directive).
<p>
<li> <strong >--target-directory</strong>=<code >pathname</code> <br/> 
           <code >Pathname</code> defines the directory where generated files should be
            written.  By default this is the directory where <strong >bisonc++</strong> is
            called. 
<p>
<li> <strong >--thread-safe</strong><br/> 
           No static data are modified, making <strong >bisonc++</strong> thread-safe.
<p>
<li> <strong >--usage</strong><br/>
            Writes basic usage information to the standard output stream and
            terminates. 
<p>
<li> <strong >--verbose</strong> (<strong >-V</strong>)<br/> 
           Writes a file containing verbose descriptions of the parser states
            and what is done for each type of look-ahead token in that state.
            This file also describes all conflicts detected in the grammar,
            both those resolved by operator precedence and those that remain
            unresolved.  It is not created by default, but if requested the
            information is written on <code >&lt;grammar&gt;.output</code>, where
            <code >&lt;grammar&gt;</code> is the grammar specification file passed to <strong >bisonc++</strong>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--version</strong> (<strong >-v</strong>)<br/>
            Displays <strong >bisonc++</strong>'s version number and terminates.

Where:
  [OPTIONS] - zero or more optional arguments (int options between
